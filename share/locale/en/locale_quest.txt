13305	Hey! Do you have the key to free me?
13306	Please set me free. Can't anybody help me?
13307	Hey, you! Please get the key!
2	I've already told you all about the powers we'll[ENTER]need to confront Sung Mahi.[ENTER][ENTER]Hurry along and find the Captain.[ENTER][ENTER]Return when you have the necessary cloth.
1	A special cloth
3	Increase your power
4	Find the Captain to acquire the necessary cloth.
5	Greetings! Theowahdan must have told you to come[ENTER]and see me. Recently I've felt how Sung Mahi[ENTER]grows ever more powerful.[ENTER][ENTER]Every last one of us must hone their powers, or[ENTER]else Sung Mahi will destroy us all. I can get you[ENTER]a special cloth for your Shoulder Sash, but it[ENTER]won't be easy![ENTER][ENTER]Give me three hours, then I'll be able to give[ENTER]you the cloth.
6	If you return in three hours, I'll have the cloth[ENTER]ready for you.[ENTER][ENTER]That's a promise![ENTER][ENTER]Make sure to come back and meet me here in three[ENTER]hours!
7	Ah, you're back! I managed it: here's the cloth,[ENTER]just as I promised.[ENTER][ENTER]Remember, it is absolutely vital that every one[ENTER]of us further increases their strength. This will[ENTER]take some time.[ENTER][ENTER]Pay me another visit, should you need my help.
8	You have gathered the necessary amount of Fine[ENTER]Cloth. Return to Theowahdan and give them to him.
9	Too soon! The three hours haven't elapsed yet!
10	Time remaining:
11	Three hours have now passed.[ENTER][ENTER]Go to the Captain.
12	Theowahdan would like to see you. Pay him a visit[ENTER]and listen to his story.
13	You seem very powerful.[ENTER][ENTER]I have been investigating how to hold back Sung[ENTER]Mahi's powers for many years.
14	Now I have finally found a way to counteract his[ENTER]incalculable power.[ENTER][ENTER]You see, you can strengthen your power using a[ENTER]Shoulder Sash. I think that you should be able to[ENTER]defeat Sung Mahi with this sash. I do not have[ENTER]enough materials, however. Go to the Captain. He[ENTER]will give you the Fine Cloth needed to produce a[ENTER]Shoulder Sash.
15	You know where the Captain can be found. I will[ENTER]mark his position on the map so that it is a[ENTER]little clearer. Seek him out now and talk to him.[ENTER]He will give you the cloth.[ENTER][ENTER]Once you have 40 Fine Cloths, bring them to me.[ENTER][ENTER]I will then make an excellent Shoulder Sash out[ENTER]of them for you.
16	Fetch 40 Fine Cloths? Yes / No
17	Seek out the Captain to complete the task and to[ENTER]acquire the necessary cloth.
18	Seek out Theowahdan and talk to him.
19	Greetings. I see that you have gathered all the[ENTER]cloth that we require. I am happy to say that you[ENTER]now have the power to fight against Sung Mahi.[ENTER][ENTER]We'll meet again!
20	What is a Shoulder Sash?
21	The Shoulder Sash gives you two options:[ENTER]Combination and Absorption.[ENTER][ENTER]You can only carry out combination between two[ENTER]sashes of the same grade. Two combined sashes can[ENTER]generate a higher grade sash.[ENTER][ENTER]In absorption, bonuses are taken from a weapon or[ENTER]armour piece at various percentage rates and are[ENTER]then applied onto the Shoulder Sash.[ENTER][ENTER]The absorption rate (%) is then dependant on the[ENTER]grade of the sash. When absorbing bonuses, the[ENTER]selected weapon or armour piece will be[ENTER]destroyed.
22	Combination
23	Would you like to combine two sashes?
24	Absorption of bonuses
25	Do you want to absorb bonuses from your weapon or[ENTER]armour?
27	You want to fight against yourself?[ENTER]Do as you please, but you don't need an arena for[ENTER]that.[ENTER]Come again when you're ready to take this[ENTER]seriously.

11823	What is the Aura Outfit?
11824	The Aura Outfit can be improved and can reach[ENTER]higher stages through evolution. This increases[ENTER]the absorption rate. You can improve your Aura[ENTER]Outfit using Aura Ice Runes, which are dropped by[ENTER]monsters. The opportunity for evolution is[ENTER]unlocked on particular levels (49, 99, 149, 199,[ENTER]249). The values’ absorption rate varies[ENTER]depending on each level. Armband, Necklace,[ENTER]Earring and Shield values can be transmitted onto[ENTER]the Aura Outfit. The item whose values are[ENTER]transmitted is destroyed during this procedure.

302	You have collected all ten Orc Teeth! Thank you.[ENTER]Now I just need a special stone. It's called[ENTER]Jinunggyi's Soul Stone. It would be great if you[ENTER]could get hold of it. You can get it from the[ENTER]Orcs.
303	Hm, this tooth is already rotting. I don't think[ENTER]it's going to be any use to me for my research.[ENTER]Please bring me another one![ENTER][ENTER]However, I will need time to examine this one. I[ENTER]won't need another tooth until tomorrow.
304	Please come back when you have found another Orc[ENTER]Tooth.

325	Hm, that's very good. But perhaps you could try[ENTER]it again?
326	It's great that you're here - I need your help.[ENTER]I'm collecting information about all the[ENTER]creatures that live on our continent. It's a very[ENTER]complicated task, that I just can't handle by[ENTER]myself. If you help me, I will of course give you[ENTER]a reward.
327	I'm currently examining the Orcs in the Valley of[ENTER]Seungryong. Orc Teeth can even grind iron, which[ENTER]is an incredibly interesting fact. Despite the[ENTER]obvious differences, a lot of researchers think[ENTER]that the human race is related to the Orc race.[ENTER]Perhaps the Orc's molars will be able to tell me[ENTER]more and give me a vital clue about the history[ENTER]of our development.
328	Could you bring me a few Orc Teeth? They do,[ENTER]however, need to be molars. Just bring me one at[ENTER]a time, so I can examine them individually. Good[ENTER]luck!

341	Hm, this book is barely readable and the pages[ENTER]fall apart when I try to turn them... I'm sorry,[ENTER]but this book is useless to me.

362	Listen to me.
363	Ah, it's good that you are here! I need your[ENTER]help. Not only am I studying every creature in[ENTER]this kingdom, but I'm also making notes about[ENTER]various magic spells. I can't do it all by myself[ENTER]because I don't have enough time to go on[ENTER]excursions. Would you take care of that for me?
364	I want to find out more about the secret sect in[ENTER]the Valley of Seungryong. I think they have[ENTER]information about the magic of the olden days;[ENTER]I'm especially interested in the Curse Books that[ENTER]they have produced. They are probably the key[ENTER]piece of info that I'm missing for my research.
365	Please bring me these books! And make sure that[ENTER]they are intact - some of them are so old that[ENTER]they are barely legible.[ENTER]I can't do with any of those.[ENTER]I need a total of 15 Curse Books for my research.[ENTER]Just bring me one at a time so that I can study[ENTER]them individually.

377	You have got hold of all 15 Demon's Keepsakes![ENTER]Thank you. Now I just need Sagyi's Soul Stone to[ENTER]find out all of their secrets. Would you do this[ENTER]for me? You can get it from the demons in the[ENTER]Demon Tower.
378	Hm, do you see these deep scratches? I'm afraid I[ENTER]can't learn much from this damaged keepsake.[ENTER]Please get me another one![ENTER][ENTER]I will however need time to analyse it. I won't[ENTER]be able to examine the next Demon's Keepsake[ENTER]until tomorrow.

399	During the course of my research I would like to[ENTER]study the demons in the Demon Tower.[ENTER]I can feel the dark energy of the building and[ENTER]from the creatures inside it from here. Can you[ENTER]get hold of a Demon's Keepsake for me for my[ENTER]research?
400	I would be very grateful for your help. But[ENTER]please keep this in mind: Demon's Keepsakes have[ENTER]different levels of quality. However I need[ENTER]keepsakes of high quality for my research.[ENTER]Altogether I need 15 of them. Please bring them[ENTER]to me one at a time, as the research takes quite[ENTER]a bit of time.

416	Hm, this one has unfortunately already melted and[ENTER]is useless to me. Please get me another one![ENTER][ENTER]I'm still going to try and find out as much as[ENTER]possible about this snow slush though. I won't be[ENTER]able to examine the next Ice Marble until[ENTER]tomorrow.

439	Oh, it's you! Come closer. At the moment I'm[ENTER]gathering information about the Ice Land in the[ENTER]west and the creatures that live there.[ENTER]Unfortunately I can't go myself and enrich my[ENTER]research with my own observations. Could you take[ENTER]care of this for me?
440	Have you ever seen the country of eternal ice?[ENTER]Rumour has it that it was surrounded by an[ENTER]unexplainable power in the olden days. That's why[ENTER]magicians and scholars are so interested in this[ENTER]place nowadays. But due to its remoteness, it has[ENTER]barely been explored.
441	Apparently the Ice Marbles, which the mountain[ENTER]partly consists of, have an unusual crystalline[ENTER]structure. Bring me 20 of them, but bring them to[ENTER]me individually so that I can examine them[ENTER]separately. And make sure that you don't bring me[ENTER]ones that have already half melted, because they[ENTER]won't keep long enough for my extensive[ENTER]experiments.

455	Hello, it's good to see you! I'm studying the[ENTER]Ghost Forest and the strange creatures that live[ENTER]there at the moment. As you already know, I don't[ENTER]have enough time to go on excursions so I'm[ENTER]reliant on your help. Would you collect some[ENTER]information for me?
457	You got hold of 25 Zelkova Branches for biologist[ENTER]Chaegirab's research. Chaegirab needs Gyimok's[ENTER]Soul Stone to help him fully understand the[ENTER]branches' properties.
458	You can get it from the trees in the Ghost Forest.
459	You have found Gyimok's Soul Stone.
460	I've got Gyimok's Soul Stone.
461	Thank you so much![ENTER]As a reward, I'm going to give you this recipe.[ENTER]Its contents isn't known by many and its secret[ENTER]is carefully guarded. Go and look for Baek-Go.[ENTER]He'll produce the potion for you. Farewell, my[ENTER]friend.

466	As a reward for fulfilling Chaegirab's request,[ENTER]your damage resistance will permanently increase[ENTER]by 10% and your movement speed will increase by[ENTER]11 points.
467	It's about the place they call the Ghost Forest.[ENTER]After the Metin Stones spread their influence[ENTER]over the continent, terrible ghosts overtook this[ENTER]place. This makes it one of the most interesting[ENTER]but also most dangerous places to study. So be[ENTER]careful.
468	I need 25 Zelkova Branches for my research -[ENTER]however I only need ones that are thin and[ENTER]completely intact. Just bring me one branch at a[ENTER]time, as the research takes quite a lot of time.

481	Oh, you've found a tablet![ENTER]Give me a second to check it...
482	Oh! This Tugyi's Tablet has top quality! I'm[ENTER]going to start examining it immediately. However,[ENTER]I do need another %s of them. Please try and find[ENTER]some![ENTER][ENTER]And remember that I need time for the analysis. I[ENTER]won't be able to examine the next one until[ENTER]tomorrow.
483	You have got hold of all 30 of Tugyi's Tablets.[ENTER]Thank you. Now I just need Tugyi's Soul Stone to[ENTER]help me understand the cause of the giants'[ENTER]strength. Would you take care of this for me? You[ENTER]can get it from the Ogres at the Snakefield.
484	Hm, this tablet looks rather weather-beaten.[ENTER]Look, it's already breaking now and I've barely[ENTER]touched it. I'm afraid it's not much use for my[ENTER]research. Please get me another one![ENTER][ENTER]I will try to do a few easy experiments with this[ENTER]one though. I won't be able to examine the next[ENTER]Tugyi's Tablet until tomorrow.

Thanks to your help[ENTER]I was able to find out lots of important[ENTER]information about the giants at the Snakefield.

It's a very extensive[ENTER]task and naturally I need first-hand information.[ENTER]Would you go to the Snakefield for me? You know[ENTER]I'm not mean when it comes to rewards.
504	The Snakefield is beyond the mountain range at[ENTER]the brink of the desert. Apparently giants live[ENTER]in that deserted place. They are not only[ENTER]powerful, but also very aggressive. Each one of[ENTER]them carries a small tablet with them and I'm[ENTER]wondering whether they contain the secret of[ENTER]their power.
505	Please get hold of 30 of these tablets from the[ENTER]Ogres at the Snakefield. Bring me one at a time[ENTER]so that I can study them individually. Please[ENTER]remember that I can only use undamaged, complete[ENTER]tablets.

515	Biologist Chaegirab:
516	I want to find out more about the Red Forest. It[ENTER]used to be a peaceful forest with huge trees. But[ENTER]the influence of the Metin Stones has[ENTER]contaminated it with bad energy and has[ENTER]transformed it into a cursed place full of evil[ENTER]spirits. To find out more about this area, I need[ENTER]some Red Ghost Tree Branches.
517	Biologist Chaegirab:
518	Could you get me 40 of these branches? Make sure[ENTER]that they're not too thin or broken. I can only[ENTER]use strong, healthy branches for my research. And[ENTER]bring them to me individually so that I can check[ENTER]each one separately.

538	Biologist Chaegirab:
539	Hm, this branch is rather thin and slightly bent.[ENTER]It's not going to be much use for my research,[ENTER]I'm afraid.

648	It concerns the beautiful Wisdom Jewels - they're[ENTER]especially clear and pure diamonds which[ENTER]apparently contain the essence of the killed[ENTER]Goddess Bahar-Taraji.

12532	Alright. I'm working on something completely[ENTER]new...[ENTER]I'm sure you've never seen anything like it.
12533	I need Purified Cores for my research.[ENTER]They are extremely rare because they are often[ENTER]found to contain impurities upon closer[ENTER]inspection.[ENTER]Please only bring me perfectly pure specimens.
12534	Gather Purified Cores for Chaegirab.[ENTER]You'll find them on monsters from the new[ENTER]continent.
12535	What, are you too busy or something?
12536	Bring Purified Cores to Chaegirab.[ENTER]Purified Cores remaining: %d
12537	Have you got some Purified Cores for me?[ENTER]Ah, very good. Let me have a look at them...
12538	I'm afraid this core has a slight impurity.[ENTER]You'll have to keep on looking.
12539	I finally have all %d Purified Cores![ENTER]And I have you to thank for that. You should[ENTER]receive a reward for it.
12540	Wow, that is an absolutely pure core. Fantastic![ENTER]Please bring me %d more.
12541	Please bring me some Purified Cores.
12542	I'm in the middle of inspecting this core still.[ENTER]Please come back again later![ENTER]Remaining cooldown: %s
12543	A Time Spiral can reduce the cooldown.
12544	I have gathered all the Purified Cores.[ENTER]Now head back to Chaegirab quickly.
12545	One of the your Sung Ma's will powers will be[ENTER]improved: STR, RES, VIT or INT.

12570	Aggression in the Caves
12571	Chaegirab is still busy with his research.[ENTER]Go and see if he needs any help.
12572	Do you remember the gnoll caves near here?[ENTER]The monsters there have been getting increasingly[ENTER]aggressive lately. That's dangerous for the[ENTER]villagers.[ENTER]Will you help me resolve that?
12573	Yes
12574	No
12575	I think the spores of the Shadowfern you brought[ENTER]out of the caves sowed new ferns everywhere on[ENTER]your way out.[ENTER]Some monsters are unable to tolerate the spores[ENTER]of that plant.
12576	Please bring me %d undamaged Shadowfern seedlings. 
12577	Gather Shadowferns in the gnoll caves for[ENTER]Chaegirab's research.
12578	The village has already come under attack. Are[ENTER]you sure you're okay with that?
12579	Gather Shadowferns in the gnoll caves for[ENTER]Chaegirab's research.[ENTER]Shadowferns remaining: %d
12580	Did you find the fern?[ENTER]Quick, let me see it...
12581	Hmmm, I'm afraid this fern is damaged. It has[ENTER]already dispersed all of its spores.[ENTER]Please bring me another one.
12582	You have brought me all %d Shadowfern plants![ENTER]You've earned a reward for doing this.
12583	This Shadowfern is ideal for my research.[ENTER]Please bring me %d more.
12584	Collect more Shadowferns.
12585	I found all the Shadowferns.[ENTER]Now head back to Chaegirab quickly.
12591	Don't hurry me! Even this wilted Shadowfern holds[ENTER]insights for science.[ENTER]Come back again later and bring me a new plant.[ENTER]Remaining cooldown: %s

679	Defeat the Jin-Hee
678	Revenge for the Ringtrader
680	The Old Lady has asked for your support: her[ENTER]friend, the Ringtrader was murdered by the[ENTER]Jin-Hee, the elite of the White Oath. Avenge the[ENTER]death of the Ringtrader by killing 30 Jin-Hee.
681	Number of Jin-Hee left: %s
682	Oh, I see you have you fought against the[ENTER]Jin-Hee? And you obviously couldn't defeat them[ENTER]all. I know about their strength and their skills[ENTER]- it's not an easy job. 
683	The Ringtrader's family went into deep mourning[ENTER]after his death. It would be very noble of you if[ENTER]you could avenge his death to help them get over[ENTER]their loss.
684	It's a shame that you don't want to avenge the[ENTER]Ringtrader's death. But of course every life has[ENTER]its value and of course you value your own life.
685	You can see something in the Old Lady's hands[ENTER]when she turns away. It's a shiny object - it[ENTER]could be a valuable stone.
686	I'll try again.
687	I'm not interested in valuable stones. I want the[ENTER]Ringtrader's death to be avenged, for the sake of[ENTER]his family. It's nice that you have reconsidered[ENTER]and want to fulfil the mission.
688	My thoughts are with the Ringtrader's family at[ENTER]this difficult time. It's a shame that you didn't[ENTER]accept the challenge.
690	Back to the Old Lady
689	Old Lady:
691	Go back to the Old Lady and tell her that you[ENTER]have avenged the Ringtrader's death by killing[ENTER]the Jin-Hee.
692	You have defeated 30 Jin-Hee!
693	You have defeated all Jin-Hee. Well done! The[ENTER]Ringtrader can rest in peace now. This is the[ENTER]piece of jewellery he has entrusted me with - a[ENTER]special engagement ring. It is yours now. This is[ENTER]your reward for avenging his death.[ENTER]I'm sure that's what he would have wanted.
694	You have received an engagement ring.
695	Engagement Ring
696	This ring symbolises an imminent wedding.
697	You are now one of the warriors of the village.[ENTER]If only I knew how you could use your new found[ENTER]skills. Have you ever heard of the Jin-Hee? They[ENTER]are a group of very dangerous elite warriors. One[ENTER]of them killed our village's Ringtrader. The[ENTER]merchant was not only a good friend of mine, but[ENTER]also a very fair man who sold jewellery to young[ENTER]couples who were intending to get married. Are[ENTER]you ready to avenge his death? In order to do so[ENTER]you have to kill 30 Jin-Hee...
698	I will avenge the Ringtrader.
699	No, the Jin-Hee are too strong for me.
700	That is a very wise and honourable decision! But[ENTER]remember - you have to kill 30 Jin-Hee. Be[ENTER]careful though, they are crafty and very skilled[ENTER]at hiding themselves!
701	Well, that is a regrettable decision, but it is[ENTER]up to you. After all, overconfidence can be[ENTER]lethal. Take care!
702	Amount of remaining Jin-Hee
703	You have defeated all Jin-Hee.
704	Now that the Ringtrader's death has been avenged,[ENTER]your mission is complete.

10153	That is a worthy title! The statue will now bear[ENTER]this name for a while.
10154	You have not entered a name.
10155	That name is invalid. Please choose another.
10156	You cannot use this name again. Please choose[ENTER]another.

806	In the Devil's Catacomb
805	Destroy this gate's seal to reach the 3rd floor!
807	Access has been denied to you. You do not have[ENTER]enough experience to survive in the Devil's[ENTER]Catacomb. Come back when you have reached a[ENTER]minimum level of 75.
808	You are too weak to survive in the Devil's[ENTER]Catacomb. Come back when you have defeated the[ENTER]Death Reaper on the 9th floor of the Demon Tower.
809	You have to wait 30 minutes before you can[ENTER]re-enter.
810	Do you want to enter the Devil's Catacomb?
811	Yes, let me enter!
812	No, I don't wish to enter.
813	You won't be able to achieve anything here as a[ENTER]lone fighter. You can only enter the next floor[ENTER]with a group.
814	Your group has already entered the dungeon.
815	The entrance portal has been opened. Enter it[ENTER]quickly!
817	The real adventure begins here! However, you have[ENTER]another hour to explore the Devil's Catacomb.
816	You have %s minute(s) left.
818	The time has expired. For your own safety you[ENTER]will be teleported out of the Devil's Catacomb.
819	Access has been denied to you. The door is still[ENTER]locked.
820	Whilst examining the stone more closely, you[ENTER]discover an engraving.
821	Merely the owner of the Shrunken Head can enter,[ENTER]after the seals of all three doors have been[ENTER]broken open.[ENTER][ENTER]If you are not carrying this relic on you, you[ENTER]will be teleported out of the Devil's Catacomb.
822	You own the Shrunken Head and are now being[ENTER]teleported onto the 3rd floor.
823	You do not own a Shrunken Head. Thus you will now[ENTER]be teleported out of the Devil's Catacomb.
824	You will be teleported at any moment.
825	The right Metin stone has been destroyed. You can[ENTER]now enter the 4th floor.
826	You destroyed the wrong Metin stone. Find the[ENTER]right one!
828	You've done it! Here's the labyrinth's exit.[ENTER]Now go down to the 5th floor.
827	Stay close to your group so that you are not left[ENTER]behind.
829	A blood-curdling cry echoes out from the depths[ENTER]of the Devil's Catacomb. Charon has awoken!
830	You have defeated Charon! Now you will be[ENTER]teleported to the last floor of the Devil's[ENTER]Catacomb.
831	Defeat Azrael!
832	Azrael has been defeated. Peace finally reigns in[ENTER]Devil's Catacomb again. Now you will be[ENTER]teleported to the surface.
833	You have been defeated. The Dragon God's Blessing[ENTER]saved you in the nick of time and is now taking[ENTER]you out of the Devil's Catacomb.
834	Destroy the creatures to receive the Soul Crystal[ENTER]Key. It opens the door to the 2nd floor.
835	Look for the right Metin stone and destroy it!
836	Find your way out of the labyrinth to reach the[ENTER]5th floor!
837	Defeat the Demon Guards to receive the Grimace[ENTER]Totem. It will serve you as the key to the 6th[ENTER]floor.
838	Defeat Charon and his henchmen!
840	You have proved that you have an excellent sense[ENTER]of hearing and instinct and have destroyed the[ENTER]real Metin Stone! Now you can enter the 4th[ENTER]floor.
839	Into the Demon Tower...
841	You are at the sealed gate on the 4th floor. You[ENTER]need to open the five Ancient Seals to get to the[ENTER]next floor. The path there is full of creatures[ENTER]that will be waiting to pounce on you. Some of[ENTER]them have keys on them. Get hold of enough Key[ENTER]Stones, to open all five Ancient Seals and to get[ENTER]to the 5th floor. But beware: You only have 20[ENTER]minutes time!
842	You have 15 minutes left.
843	You have opened the Key Stones' seal and can now[ENTER]enter the 5th floor. The Proud Demon King is also[ENTER]on that floor. Destroy all the creatures that you[ENTER]meet there.
844	You have opened the seal! There are %s left.
845	Kill all monsters on the 6th floor!
846	You've killed all the creatures. Now go to the[ENTER]Blacksmith and pick up your reward - he will[ENTER]improve an item of your choice. In order to do[ENTER]this, drag the item that you want to improve onto[ENTER]the Blacksmith.
847	The upper floors
848	You want to enter the 6th floor of the tower? It[ENTER]requires great skill and experience to deal with[ENTER]this floor. I can teleport you there, but only[ENTER]once you've reached level 75.
850	You have the necessary experience and therefore[ENTER]have a good chance of surviving the upper floors.[ENTER]You can enter now!
849	Demon Tower Guard:
851	Go!
852	Leave the tower
853	I can't allow you to enter the upper floors. You[ENTER]do not have enough experience yet. Come back when[ENTER]you have reached a minimum level of 75.
854	The Zin-Sa-Gui Tower Map opens up the path to the[ENTER]next floor. You can find them by destroying the[ENTER]Metin Stones.
855	This map teleports you to the 7th floor of the[ENTER]Demon Tower.
856	Find the right key to enter the next floor. You[ENTER]need the Zin-Bong-In Key to open Sa-Soe's seal.
857	Kill the leader of the demons.
858	You have completed the quest successfully and[ENTER]will be teleported out in a few minutes.
859	I'll be expecting you at Devil's Catacomb![ENTER]Follow me and my wrath will descend upon you like[ENTER]a tornado!
860	This tower is swarming with devils. Only the[ENTER]strongest can reach the top. Rumour has it that[ENTER]no one who has entered that tower has ever got[ENTER]out of there alive. You cannot enter the tower[ENTER]yet, as you haven't reached level 40.
861	This tower is swarming with devils. Only the[ENTER]strongest can reach the top. Rumour has it that[ENTER]no one who has entered that tower has ever got[ENTER]out of there alive. Do you still want to enter[ENTER]the Demon Tower?
862	You are at the sealed gate on the 3rd floor.[ENTER]A lot of fake stones are waiting here to confuse[ENTER]you, but one of them is the very important Metin[ENTER]Stone. You have to destroy it within 15 minutes[ENTER]or you will not be able to pass back through the[ENTER]gate.
863	There are 10 minutes remaining.
864	There are 5 minutes remaining.
865	Your time is up.
866	The fake Metin Stones are disappearing.

869	That wasn't the right number!
870	I'll try again.
871	You're the first to demand entry to the Dragon's[ENTER]Temple. I'll let you in, as long as you have[ENTER]enough Twisted Keys. First you have to determine[ENTER]the secret code. Pass the secret code on to your[ENTER]competitors within the next 5 minutes so that[ENTER]they can also enter the room.[ENTER]Please remember that the power of the key only[ENTER]lasts 60 minutes. The dragon has to be defeated[ENTER]within this time frame!
872	I'm ready!
873	OK, I'm going to define the code now:
874	The code can only contain digits.
875	%s's group is trying to kill the Blue Dragon!
876	You don't have enough keys! To activate the[ENTER]portal, I need 3x
877	You can get it from the evil leaders Yonghan and[ENTER]Huashin.
878	I want to leave this place!
879	I'll take you back to the grotto's entrance.
880	Yes, do that.
881	No, I'll stay here.
882	Another group is already trying to kill the[ENTER]dragon. You'll have to wait a while before you[ENTER]can enter the Dragon's Temple.
883	If you like, I can take you to the dragon's cave[ENTER]immediately. Give me

897	Ghostly Polymorph Marbles
898	Ghost of a Warrior:
899	So, you want a Polymorph Marble, do you? To[ENTER]create one I need 150,000 Yang and %s of the[ENTER]following materials:
900	Bring me the materials and 150,000 Yang and I'll[ENTER]create the Polymorph Marble. However, with my old[ENTER]hands I can't guarantee that there won't be any[ENTER]mistakes.
901	Understood.
902	No, that sounds too arduous.
903	Fine, that's your decision.

910	You still need %s of the following materials:
911	You've collected all the required materials.[ENTER]Return to the Ghost of a Warrior. You'll find him[ENTER]in the second level of the Grotto of Exile. You[ENTER]also require 150,000 Yang to receive the marble.
912	You haven't managed to collect the required[ENTER]materials in the allowed time.
913	Do you want to give me %s of this material?
914	Sadly you cannot afford my services.[ENTER]I require 150,000 Yang from you.
915	Here you go!
916	No thanks, I'd rather keep them myself!
917	Thank you, you have worked hard.[ENTER]Everything went according to plan. I'm clearly[ENTER]not as rusty as I thought. Here, take this:
918	Oh dear, my brittle old bones have failed me[ENTER]again. I wasn't able to craft any Polymorph[ENTER]Marbles. Allow me to give you this item by way of[ENTER]recompense:
919	As you wish.
920	Dragon Stone Shard
921	In your hand lies the fragment of a stone. It[ENTER]sparkles as if full of secrets and you can sense[ENTER]its power as it flows through you.[ENTER]What kind of stone is it? Take it to the[ENTER]alchemist. He will be able to help you further.
922	Dragon Stone Shard
923	That is a fragment of a Dragon Stone - an[ENTER]extremely scarce and valuable crystal with great[ENTER]power. It is said that such a stone is the soul[ENTER]of a dragon. Unbelievably beautiful![ENTER]Do you feel its power as it flows through you as[ENTER]soon as you pick it up and carry it?[ENTER]Bring me a total of ten Dragon Stone Shards. I[ENTER]can then turn them into a complete stone.
924	Dragon Stone transmutation
925	Don't be so impatient. I can only transmute ten[ENTER]shards into a Dragon Stone. Keep searching!
926	Ah, very good! You have found ten Dragon Stone[ENTER]Shards. Please wait a moment.[ENTER]...[ENTER]Done it! My my, we've managed to create a Cor[ENTER]Draconis through the process - a crystalline[ENTER]dragon heart that encases and protects the Dragon[ENTER]Stone.[ENTER]Break it open to find out which stone it contains.It will be moved directly to the Dragon Stone[ENTER]Alchemy inventory.[ENTER]Did you know that you can also further refine[ENTER]Dragon Stones?
927	You would like another Cor Draconis? Bah, I'm[ENTER]past my prime already and the production process[ENTER]for such a complex item wears my strength out.[ENTER]But I will try for you. Although, even at my[ENTER]best, I am not going to manage more than ten a[ENTER]day!
928	That's enough for today. I simply can't manage to[ENTER]make more than ten a day. I'm at the end of my[ENTER]strength and I need to rest. Come again tomorrow.
929	Open shop
930	Arrival of the Dragon Stone Shard
931	The most knowledgeable mineral alchemist in the[ENTER]entire kingdom is looking for you. Go to him as[ENTER]soon as possible!
932	Dragon Stone Shard?!
933	Ah, there you are! I have discovered something[ENTER]quite remarkable: the fragment of a Dragon Stone![ENTER]A Dragon Stone is an extremely rare and valuable[ENTER]crystal with great power. It is said that they[ENTER]were once the soul of a dragon. Unbelievably[ENTER]beautiful! I will give you the Power of the[ENTER]Dragon Eye, so that you too can detect the shards[ENTER]too.[ENTER]Bring me a total of ten Dragon Stone Shards.[ENTER]I will then be able to transmute them into a[ENTER]complete stone.
934	Gather Dragon Stone Shards
935	Bring the alchemist 10 Dragon Stone Shards.
936	Ah, very good! You have found ten Dragon Stone[ENTER]Shards. Please wait a moment.[ENTER]...[ENTER]Incredible! The transmutation has resulted in a[ENTER]Cor Draconis - a crystalline dragon heart, that[ENTER]protectively surrounds the Dragon Stone.[ENTER]When you break it open, the Dragon Stone within[ENTER]will then go straight into the Dragon Stone[ENTER]Alchemy inventory.[ENTER]To find Dragon Stone Shards, you will need the[ENTER]Power of the Dragon Eye. I can lend it to you -[ENTER]just come and see me every day. Then you too will[ENTER]be able to transmute Dragon Stones! I have[ENTER]already done one for you today, the remaining %d[ENTER]you can manage on your own.
937	Hey, don't waste any time! Get out there and[ENTER]search for Dragon Stone Shards!
938	Power of the Dragon Eye
940	Remaining Power of the Dragon Eye: %d
939	Select.
941	There are no more Dragon Stone Shards.
942	Give me the Power of the Dragon Eye
943	Hello! You have already received the Power of the[ENTER]Dragon Eye today. The process weakens me so much[ENTER]that I can only help you once a day. Come again[ENTER]tomorrow!
944	Hello! I bet that you are here for the Power of[ENTER]the Dragon Eye. Correct? Very well then, here you[ENTER]are. Good luck on your hunt! I hope you find[ENTER]enough shards for ten Dragon Stones!
945	Power of the Dragon Eye missing
946	The Power of the Dragon Eye has left you.
947	Go back to the alchemist tomorrow to once again[ENTER]gain the Power of the Dragon Eye!
948	Go to the alchemist to get yourself the Power of[ENTER]the Dragon Eye!
11732	Dragon Stone Shards+?!
11733	Rumour has it that the monsters in the Illusion[ENTER]dungeons carry mysterious stones on them...
11734	Let's find out.
11735	No, not now.
11736	There are no more Dragon Stone Shards+.
11737	Power of the Dragon Eye Missing
11738	The Power of the Dragon Eye has left you.
11739	Time remaining: %s
11740	Collect Dragon Stone Shards+
11741	Take on the monsters in the Illusion dungeons to[ENTER]collect 10 Dragon Stone Shards+.
11742	Remaining Power of the Dragon Eye: %d
949	Cor Draconis as a gift
950	Controlling the Power of the Dragon Eye is not as[ENTER]easy as it seems. Only experienced warriors are[ENTER]capable. Train a little longer in the art of[ENTER]battle and then return when you have reached at[ENTER]least level 50.
951	To be able to use a Cor Draconis, you will need[ENTER]to be able to use the Power of the Dragon Eye.[ENTER]Come back again when you believe you are capable[ENTER]of this!
952	Ah, I sense the Power of the Dragon Eye within[ENTER]you. As a mark of my deep respect, I would like[ENTER]to present you with this Cor Draconis.[ENTER]One stone a day - I am afraid I cannot spare any[ENTER]more.
953	Here you go, your Cor Draconis. You're welcome.
954	I'm very sorry, I cannot spare more than one a[ENTER]day. Come again tomorrow. Perhaps I will have a[ENTER]new Cor Draconis for you then.

10860	Mythical Dragon Stone: Bonus Change
10861	Only the Flame of the Dragon has the power to[ENTER]alter the bonuses of a Mythical Dragon Stone. The[ENTER]number of flames required depends on the clarity[ENTER]of the Dragon Stone. Do you really want to change[ENTER]your bonuses? You cannot reverse the process.
12089	Leave
12090	Do you want to leave the Elemental Realm?
12083	Enter the Elemental Realm
12084	You must be at least level 90 and pay an entrance[ENTER]fee of 5,000,000 Yang. Do you want to enter the[ENTER]Elemental Realm?
12085	Yes
12086	No
12087	Your level is too low.
12088	You don't have enough Yang.
963	A new technology!
964	I've done it![ENTER]I have finally managed to develop a completely[ENTER]new technology.[ENTER]I've managed to process items and extract pure[ENTER]energy from them. It's absolutely brilliant!
965	If you destroy an item using my new technology,[ENTER]you will receive an Energy Fragment. If you merge[ENTER]30 of these fragments, you will receive a[ENTER]powerful Energy Crystal! Pure, unfiltered energy,[ENTER]bundled with a Gemstone. This power will flow[ENTER]into your entire equipment.[ENTER]Are you interested in it?
966	Bring equipment items such as weapons, jewellery[ENTER]and the clothing that you find whilst on the hunt[ENTER]to me. I will process them into Energy Fragments.[ENTER]Our kingdom's future and hope has been pinned on[ENTER]this technology. We will become invincible!
967	Extract Energy Fragments
968	Did it work? Did you receive Energy Fragments?[ENTER]Bring me more items and I will shatter them using[ENTER]alchemy. My technology has not quite been[ENTER]perfected yet. That's why I can never guarantee[ENTER]how many fragments you will receive.
969	There is one condition: your own level as well as[ENTER]that of the item must have a minimum level of 35.[ENTER]Hm, let's take a look...
970	You aren't strong enough yet! Come again, when[ENTER]you have reached a minimum level of 35.
971	Ah, excellent! You are strong and experienced.[ENTER]Give me the item that you want me to process.
972	You are not strong enough to control the power[ENTER]inside these Energy Fragments. Come again when[ENTER]you have reached a minimum level of 35.
973	This item is not suitable for my technology.[ENTER]Bring me something else.
974	This item does not have enough energy. Bring me[ENTER]one with a minimum level of 35 - that's the only[ENTER]way I'll be able extract its energy with my[ENTER]technology.
10822	Your item has %d or more bonuses. Do you still[ENTER]want to disassemble it?
975	Should I destroy this item?
976	Yes!
977	No, not yet!
978	I have failed - unfortunately I could not extract[ENTER]any Energy Fragments. Perhaps I'll have better[ENTER]luck next time.
979	Wonderful! I managed to find %d Energy Fragments.[ENTER]There you go.
980	Produce Energy Crystal
981	Have you used up all your power reserves already?[ENTER]You shouldn't work so hard and put your life on[ENTER]the line in such a careless way. I will need %d[ENTER]Energy Fragments to produce an Energy Crystal.
982	You do not have enough Energy Fragments.[ENTER]I can't produce an Energy Crystal with that.[ENTER]Come again when you have collected at least %d[ENTER]fragments.
983	Very good, you have got the %d required Energy[ENTER]Fragments. I can produce an Energy Crystal with[ENTER]that. Please wait a minute. I'll try, but I can't[ENTER]guarantee it will work.
984	Everything's ready to melt the fragments into an[ENTER]Energy Crystal. However, I have to live on[ENTER]something too and my tools don't just fall from[ENTER]the sky. [ENTER] I require a small expenses[ENTER]charge of %d Yang. Are you willing to pay?
985	Of course!
986	No, not now.
987	All right, I respect your decision.[ENTER]Come again when you have changed your mind and[ENTER]need an Energy Crystal after all.
988	Sorry, you have to pay first. I'm not a charity.[ENTER]That's just business - give me the money and then[ENTER]I'll do my work.
989	Here, your Energy Crystal. But it's only the[ENTER]first attempt that's always successful. Alchemy[ENTER]is an unpredictable science - minor mistakes lead[ENTER]to failure! There is always a small chance that[ENTER]the experiment might fail.
990	Unfortunately, the attempt failed. I couldn't[ENTER]produce an Energy Crystal. My technology is[ENTER]brilliant - but the process is full of risks.[ENTER]Things don't always work according to plan. Next[ENTER]time I'm sure we'll be successful!
991	I knew it! My technology is brilliant![ENTER]Here's your Energy Crystal. It's certainly a fine[ENTER]specimen! Can you feel its power?
13540	Do you want to enter the Serpent Temple?
13014	Enter the Serpent Temple
13020	Important Preparations
13021	I should find the Serpent Statue to enter the[ENTER]Serpent Temple.
13022	You will need a variety of things to progress[ENTER]through this underground dungeon... a hat, a whip[ENTER]or a little sandbag about the size of some[ENTER]treasure would surely come in handy. I can craft[ENTER]these items for you.
13023	But if you want to enter the temple, you'll have[ENTER]to bring me %d Serpent Scales for the equipment.[ENTER]And since only a hero who is willing to give it[ENTER]their all is worthy of victory, it will cost you[ENTER]%d Yang. Can you bring me both?
13024	The Serpent Statue requires %d Serpent Scales.[ENTER]You can find them on nearby monsters.
13025	To enter the Serpent Temple, I need to get the %d[ENTER]Serpent Scales the Serpent Statue requires.[ENTER]Number remaining: %d
13026	I need more Serpent Scales...
13027	You have received Serpent Scales. Collected items: %d
13028	That's all the Serpent Scales the Serpent Statue[ENTER]needs. Return to it.
13029	I have all %d Serpent Scales! I should return to[ENTER]the Serpent Statue.
13030	Have you got all the Serpent Scales? Then I'll[ENTER]just need %d Yang and I'll be able to grant you[ENTER]access to the temple.
13031	Hand Over Both
13032	Cancel
13033	You don't have enough money...
13034	Good. All done! Here are your items, good luck.[ENTER]Whenever you need more equipment for another[ENTER]expedition, simply come back to me.

1068	I can make a Teleportation Scroll for you, which[ENTER]will take you directly to the gates of the Red[ENTER]Dragon Fortress. But first you need to do me a[ENTER]favour.

1156	Fasting Citizen:
1157	I am really hungry. Show some compassion and[ENTER]break fast with me. Please bring me a Food[ENTER]Donation so that I do not starve.

1200	But think carefully how many Ice Cream Scoops you[ENTER]want to give me for the horse. I only have one of[ENTER]these fine stallions available for you.
1201	Cool, in every sense of the word!
1202	However, I need your help. The only place to get[ENTER]really great ice cream is from monsters. No, the[ENTER]heat may be unbearable, but I'm not delirious![ENTER]Could you head out and whip up a few scoops of[ENTER]ice cream for me?
1203	Collect ice cream and bring it to you... consider[ENTER]it done!

1205	You've stolen the ice cream from the monsters.[ENTER]Now go and surprise Summer.
1206	Oh, still no joy? Be quick about it, otherwise[ENTER]the ice cream will melt... and puddles of ice[ENTER]cream are very awkward to carry.
1207	You've done it! Here, you've more than earned[ENTER]your share. But keep your mitts off the chocolate[ENTER]ice cream. That's mine! Enjoy the summer. And[ENTER]come back when you fancy second helpings!
10208	Talk to the NPC with the arrow above their head.[ENTER]The blinking dot on the minimap shows where you[ENTER]can find him.
10165	Welcome! I have a little present for you, but[ENTER]first I need you to do me a favour. The dark[ENTER]energy emanating from the Zodiac Temple has[ENTER]drastically increased. Fortunately this energy[ENTER]can be absorbed in Animaspheres. Please enter the[ENTER]temple and use 24 Animaspheres to reduce the[ENTER]energy level. Note: The quest cannot be completed[ENTER]if you have activated the Mark of the Guardian.
10164	Monk Milbon has been asking for you. He's waiting[ENTER]at the Zodiac Temple and has something he'd like[ENTER]to give you. The teleporter will take you there.
10163	Alarm in the Zodiac Temple
10166	Alright!
10167	Use Animaspheres to reduce the dark energy[ENTER]emanating from the Zodiac Temple before it[ENTER]becomes too powerful. You will automatically[ENTER]consume Animaspheres when you enter the temple.[ENTER]Note: The quest cannot be completed if you have[ENTER]activated the Mark of the Guardian.
10168	Done it! Return to Monk Milbon and collect your[ENTER]gift.
10169	Thank you. The temple is secure again for the[ENTER]time being. Here is your gift. The energy level[ENTER]will rise again, however. Come back in 24 hours[ENTER]and reduce the energy level with Animaspheres[ENTER]once more. I'll reward you again for doing so, of[ENTER]course.

1211	I've got more important things to do, why should[ENTER]I help an orphan?
1212	Get the Black Uniform
1213	Mirine's brother is dead and the Black Wind[ENTER]Maniacs stole the only keepsake she had of him.[ENTER]Kill Black Wind Maniacs until you find Mirine's[ENTER]brother's Black Uniform.
1214	About your brother's uniform...
1215	Do you want to abandon the search? I haven't[ENTER]asked too much of you. I would really like a[ENTER]keepsake of my brother. Please help me!
1216	Give up
1217	It's almost impossible to refuse this girl's[ENTER]request. A battle against 100 members of the[ENTER]Black Wind Gang seems to be much easier in[ENTER]comparison.
1218	I'm sorry. I feel for you, but the Black Wind[ENTER]Gang is too strong for me. Someone else with more[ENTER]experience would be better at this job.
1220	Oh no... I have asked others for help, but none[ENTER]of them have returned. You're my last hope.[ENTER]Look, this is the most valuable thing I own. I[ENTER]will give it to you as a reward.
1221	The girl carefully lifts out an item that has[ENTER]been wrapped in a blanket - it's a sword. The[ENTER]engravings on the hilt indicate that it is a very[ENTER]valuable weapon.
1219	Mirine:
1222	Accept the challenge
1223	It's not because of the reward, but I will accept[ENTER]the challenge.
1224	You are right. Nobody has ever returned - all of[ENTER]them lost their lives. Life is more important[ENTER]than any number of memories. It would be[ENTER]pointless to sacrifice even more lives. Farewell!
1225	I have found the Black Uniform!
1226	Thank you very much! He always wore this uniform.[ENTER]He never wanted to wear anything else...[ENTER]Here, take it. This is the most valuable thing[ENTER]that I own. I don't need it, so please take it.
1227	You have accepted Mirine's reward.
1228	Mirine's reward
1229	You unwrap Mirine's valuable reward and find a[ENTER]sword with a wonderfully ornamented hilt.
1230	A wonderful weapon. But... what is this? The[ENTER]blade is broken![ENTER]This beautiful piece of craftsmanship is too good[ENTER]to be thrown away. I should take the pieces to[ENTER]the blacksmith.
1232	You have received a broken sword. Take it to the[ENTER]Blacksmith to be repaired.
1231	Oh sorry, I didn't hear you come in. I was[ENTER]thinking about my poor brother. But who are you?
1233	Go to the Blacksmith
1234	Mirine was so grateful for your help that she[ENTER]gave you her most valuable possession: a[ENTER]wonderful sword which unfortunately is broken. At[ENTER]first glance you realise that it is a very[ENTER]valuable weapon, so you decide to take it to be[ENTER]repaired.
1235	Repairing the sword
1236	Can you repair the sword?
1237	That's a wonderful sword! It belonged to Mirine,[ENTER]didn't it? I heard that you helped her. Well[ENTER]done, you seem to be a honest and righteous[ENTER]person so I won't charge you for repairing the[ENTER]weapon. Wait a minute...
1238	Here, the blade is as good as new. A truly fine[ENTER]weapon. Take it, my friend.
1239	You have received a Silver Sword+2.
1240	You have received an Orchid Sword+2.
1241	You have received a Bastard Sword+2.

1245	Oh, I didn't realise that someone was nearby...[ENTER]My name is Mirine. Perhaps you could help me? My[ENTER]older brother is dead. He was on his way to get[ENTER]medicine but then...[ENTER]The only thing I have left of him is the sight of[ENTER]his grave and one keepsake: his black uniform.
1246	Mirine:
1247	On my way home, the Black Wind Gang appeared -[ENTER]one of the infamous groups of lawless assassins.[ENTER]I had to flee from them and lost my brother's[ENTER]keepsake. I'm too scared to go back there and[ENTER]look for it. Could you do it for me?

1283	General Store Saleswoman
1284	Welcome adventurer![ENTER]Oh, so the Guardian sent you? He needs a Red[ENTER]Potion? I'll give you five of them.[ENTER]Here you are. These are for regeneration of[ENTER]vitality and are actually quite tasty.
1285	You may be new in town, but I'm sure that you're[ENTER]going to become a regular customer soon.[ENTER]That's why I'm giving you these potions for free.[ENTER]Come round again some time.

1290	Go to the centre of the village and speak to the[ENTER]Guardian.He'll give you your first mission.[ENTER]You'll find him in the centre of the village.
1292	Thank you for bringing me the potion! I didn't[ENTER]even need to leave my place here in the village[ENTER]and can now fulfil my duties better. You want to[ENTER]know what I do? Well, generally I just announce[ENTER]useful information. Sometimes I also offer my[ENTER]services to people who are in trouble or are[ENTER]being attacked. But my main job is to take care[ENTER]of the guilds. If you're interested in joining or[ENTER]founding a guild, just come see me.
1293	By the way, the teachers are looking for you. You[ENTER]should head there now. Oh, I almost forgot! As a[ENTER]sign of my appreciation you can keep the change![ENTER]See you later.
1294	Guardian:

1408	Old Lady:
1407	I heard that you are a fortune teller.
1409	You are too young to be sighing like that! Do you[ENTER]want to take a look at your future? You should[ENTER]know that there are some powers out there that[ENTER]can give you the answers you need to regain some[ENTER]of your hope.
1410	Tell me my fortune
1411	Don't tell me my fortune
1412	That's right. Following your own path and trying[ENTER]to do your best is the most important thing in[ENTER]life. Farewell!
1413	Yes, I would like that.
1414	No, thanks.
1415	I may be friendly, but I can't give you a[ENTER]Talisman for free. If you want to avoid bad luck[ENTER]and misfortune, you will have to pay for it.[ENTER]It costs %s Yang.
1416	You're leaving? Perhaps you're right. Bad luck[ENTER]and sorrow are all a part of life. Take care and[ENTER]farewell. If you change your mind, come see me[ENTER]again.
1417	The look in your eyes tells me that you are very[ENTER]young. Why do you want to know your fate so early[ENTER]on in your life? Is there a particular reason for[ENTER]it? Fate still has a lot in store for you. Come[ENTER]back again later.
1418	Do you really want to live your life the way the[ENTER]fortune teller told you? You shouldn't take those[ENTER]kinds of things so seriously. The most important[ENTER]thing is your attitude and the way you act. If[ENTER]both are positive, then nothing can go wrong. If[ENTER]you still want to know your fortune, come back[ENTER]tomorrow.
1419	Old Lady:
1420	As I have already told you your prediction for[ENTER]today is as follows:
1421	Bad luck will find you and you still haven't[ENTER]bought the talisman to turn away evil yet. Are[ENTER]you interested in buying my Talisman of Wealth?
1422	Yes, I'll buy it.
1423	No, thanks.
1424	I may be friendly, but I can't give it to you for[ENTER]free. If you want to avoid bad luck and[ENTER]misfortune, you will have to pay a good price for[ENTER]the talisman.

1488	The Three Gods
1489	Once upon a time, three godly siblings formed the[ENTER]foundations of being.[ENTER]Bahar-Taraji, the Goddess of Creation, was the[ENTER]youngest of the three. Her job was to create new[ENTER]beings - wherever she went, flowers blossomed and[ENTER]life thrived.
1490	The eldest brother was called Beran-Setaou. He[ENTER]was responsible for the end of life and for[ENTER]dissolution. Whenever a life cycle was at its[ENTER]end, he separated body and soul from one another[ENTER]and led the soul into afterlife.[ENTER]And thus a steady circle of becoming and passing[ENTER]away - the foundation of all life - was ensured.
1491	The middle brother was Baljit-Elvedin. As the God[ENTER]of Conservation, he moderated between his two[ENTER]siblings and enabled the eternal circle of life[ENTER]for the creatures of earth. He was, for example,[ENTER]responsible for the coming and going of the[ENTER]seasons.
1492	The Quarrel
1493	During times of need, people begged the three[ENTER]gods for help. Though unfortunately they feared[ENTER]and disregarded Beran-Setaou, as in their[ENTER]short-sightedness they did not understand that[ENTER]just as light and dark exists, he had to exist as[ENTER]a counterpart to creation.
1494	For a long time the god ignored it, but over the[ENTER]years envy grew within him, which slowly turned[ENTER]into hate and malevolence. At first he channelled[ENTER]his anger towards the people by giving them war[ENTER]and illness. However, this only resulted in their[ENTER]further rejection of him and they increasingly[ENTER]prayed to Bahar-Taraji, goddess of newly created[ENTER]life. And thus it became the vicious circle that[ENTER]finally led to ruin.
1495	And as the wrath of the god became so intense[ENTER]that he could not control it any longer,[ENTER]something unbelievable happened: He killed his[ENTER]sister, the nation's sweetheart. This deed was[ENTER]entirely unprovoked, for on that day she treated[ENTER]her brother with the same love and trust that she[ENTER]did every day. And he, looked into those kind[ENTER]eyes and took her life away nevertheless.
1496	The Aftermath
1497	Bahar-Taraji's death had terrible consequences[ENTER]for the world of the gods as well as that of the[ENTER]people: A long and cruel winter came, killing[ENTER]creatures at sea and ashore. The earth froze so[ENTER]firmly that stones cracked and even the eldest[ENTER]and strongest trees withered away.
1498	Young people and animals died and once it finally[ENTER]became warmer, the birth rate became lower than[ENTER]ever before. The weakened country did not yield[ENTER]enough to keep the adult population fed - let[ENTER]alone enough to feed new life. Hope had died[ENTER]along with life and both needed a very long time[ENTER]to fully recover.
1499	Even the gods suffered, however, time goes by[ENTER]more slowly for them than it does for humans.[ENTER]Beran-Setaou withdrew and sought solitude, once[ENTER]the enormity of what he had done dawned on him.[ENTER]Devastating regret and deep satisfaction grappled[ENTER]inside him - until the latter won this mental[ENTER]battle. His heart turned to ice and the God of[ENTER]Dissolution became the God of Ice and Coldness,[ENTER]of Hate and of Fear.
1500	The Battle
1501	Baljit-Elvedin, God of Conservation, grieved for[ENTER]his sister for a long time. And as the tight[ENTER]claws of pain finally loosened their grip around[ENTER]his heart, he went searching for his brother.[ENTER]Level-headedness and wisdom still dominated his[ENTER]life's path and thus he recognised, despite his[ENTER]grief, that life could not continue to hang in[ENTER]imbalance.
1502	He followed his brother's trail and after many[ENTER]long years, finally found him in a cave of ice,[ENTER]hate and solitude, far removed from any other[ENTER]signs of life. Baljit-Elvedin did what he had to[ENTER]do, even though it tore yet another wound into[ENTER]his heart: He challenged his brother to a duel.[ENTER]Beran-Setaou had derailed so far off the path of[ENTER]righteousness that he did not hesitate for a[ENTER]second...
1503	Apparently, the battle was terrible and beyond[ENTER]all comprehension. Baljit-Elvedin won the battle.[ENTER]And remaining true to his morals, he did not kill[ENTER]his brother, but took his powers and locked him[ENTER]in the grotto. And thus Beran-Setaou remains here[ENTER]with the creatures that he has been creating in[ENTER]the last few centuries...
1504	I've heard enough.
1505	May your fate be different to mine. Good luck!
1506	Ghost of a warrior:
1507	Why are you translucent?
1508	What do you think?! I'm a ghost and have been[ENTER]trapped in this rock for a thousand years...
1509	Help, a ghost!
1510	Right, a ghost. Run away quickly, otherwise I'll[ENTER]eat you up!
1511	Who are you?
1512	I was a mercenary once, a simple man. My parents[ENTER]were farmers. However, I didn't want to continue[ENTER]working the same field for the rest of my life,[ENTER]so I joined the military. It was tough and[ENTER]bloody, but it wasn't all bad. But then I finally[ENTER]got tired of being bossed around by[ENTER]good-for-nothing noblemen and left. And then fate[ENTER]finally led me to this dark place.
1513	Do you know the story of the grotto?
1514	No, I don't know, I suppose I was just unlucky.[ENTER]After I had deserted, I wanted to hide in the[ENTER]mountains and stumbled upon this cave. It seemed[ENTER]a bit strange to me right from the start, but it[ENTER]was convenient and seemed completely abandoned. A[ENTER]few days later I became witness and victim of a[ENTER]unbelievable battle. If you like, I can tell you[ENTER]about it.
1515	The Beginning of the Battle
1516	One day - I was just collecting roots at the[ENTER]mountainside - a silver dragon appeared from the[ENTER]heavens. I thought he was after me, but he didn't[ENTER]even see me - he was completely focused on the[ENTER]cave's entrance. Without slowing down, he swooped[ENTER]into the valley and flung himself into the cave.
1517	And then it went quiet for a while and I didn't[ENTER]know what to do. All my equipment was in the[ENTER]cave, but of course I didn't want to come across[ENTER]the dragon! Then the ground rumbled and a dull[ENTER]roar sounded from within the depths of the cave -[ENTER]but to my horror it wasn't just one voice - but[ENTER]two! Shortly afterwards two dragons shot out of[ENTER]the cave - a silver one directly followed by a[ENTER]blue one.
1518	An almost indescribable battle ensued between the[ENTER]dragons. They ripped into each others bodies,[ENTER]became locked in a tight grip and sunk each[ENTER]others teeth into one another's necks... It was[ENTER]raining blood... But neither one loosened their[ENTER]grip for a second.
1519	The End of the Battle
1520	Both dragons rolled over the mountains like a[ENTER]thunderstorm - causing landslides and chaos all[ENTER]round. Lightning scorched the blue dragon's[ENTER]mouth, icy hail perforated the silver dragon's[ENTER]wings. The thick ice crust that had been covering[ENTER]the ground for years, melted under this onslaught[ENTER]and left a muddy residue behind. I hid behind a[ENTER]rock, petrified but incapable of ignoring the[ENTER]sight in front of me.
1521	It took hours before their powers started[ENTER]deteriorating. And then I finally saw my chance,[ENTER]tore away from scene and ran into the valley to[ENTER]get my equipment from the cave. And thus I sealed[ENTER]my fate. I was already on my way back when both[ENTER]dragons shot out from the mountains, the blue[ENTER]ahead of the silver. He had suffered terrible[ENTER]damage.
1522	Just before vanishing into the cave, the silver[ENTER]dragon caught up with him and something very[ENTER]strange happened: The sky started flickering, it[ENTER]became extremely draughty and a vortex of energy[ENTER]was created which the blue dragon got caught up[ENTER]in. He started roaring with pain and rage... he[ENTER]started shrinking, his roaring became weaker and[ENTER]his scales lost their shine before becoming blunt[ENTER]and colourless...
1523	Finally the silver dragon released the other[ENTER]dragon into the cave. With his last bit of[ENTER]strength, the loser dragged himself under the[ENTER]mountain. However, the silver dragon proceeded to[ENTER]release a powerful magic tempest, which sealed[ENTER]the cave with an energy barrier and made part of[ENTER]the mountain collapse. The dark dragon and I were[ENTER]trapped. Condemned to a miserable and[ENTER]excruciating death from starvation...
1524	I've heard enough.
1525	Thanks for listening. The last thousand years[ENTER]have been really lonely...
1526	How can I trade books?
11382	Combine Skill Books
11383	You can receive a Powershard Chest in exchange[ENTER]for 10 Skill Books and 100,000 Yang.

If you bring me 10, I'll give[ENTER]you a skill book for your class. Doesn't that[ENTER]sound like a fair deal? Oh yes, I almost forgot[ENTER]to mention that I charge a fee of 1,000,000 Yang[ENTER]for trading.

12424	Disastrous Powers
12425	Theowahdan is looking for you on the new[ENTER]continent.
12426	There is a mysterious power on this continent.[ENTER]My clan has been researching it for a while... We[ENTER]think that Sung Mahi is the source of this power.
12427	If we find out more about it, it could be of use[ENTER]to you too.[ENTER]Will you help me?
12428	Yes
12429	No
12430	I thought you'd be interested.[ENTER]For my studies, I need materials that are filled[ENTER]with this power.
12431	I'm sure it won't be a problem for you. Bring me:[ENTER]Tainted Cores[ENTER]Tainted Horns[ENTER]Tainted Skin
12432	Go and find the materials.
12433	Really? I thought you were smarter than that...[ENTER]But suit yourself.

12440	I've finally gathered all the tainted materials.[ENTER]I should take them to Theowahdan on the continent[ENTER]Yohara.

12444	I'm glad you came.[ENTER]The brightest minds in my clan have taken a look[ENTER]at the materials.[ENTER]However, I have bad news.
12445	The tainted monster parts show little effect on[ENTER]Sung Mahi's powers.[ENTER]If we are to harness his power, we'll have to dig[ENTER]deeper.[ENTER]Will you help me with that?
12446	Yes
12447	No
12448	A good decision!
12449	Sung Mahi's dark will probably isn't in the[ENTER]monsters' bodies, but in their souls and minds...[ENTER]if monsters even have such things.[ENTER]Bring me %d Tainted Soul Stones and hopefully[ENTER]we'll find out more.
12450	Gather %d Tainted Soul Stones for Theowahdan's[ENTER]research.
12451	Tainted Soul Stones remaining
12452	So, you've had enough? Please yourself.
12453	I need Tainted Soul Stones for Theowahdan's[ENTER]research.
12454	Tainted Soul Stones remaining: %d
12455	Why are you standing around here? Science doesn't[ENTER]do itself!
12456	I've gathered enough Tainted Soul Stones.[ENTER]I should take them to Theowahdan on the new[ENTER]continent.
12457	I've finally gathered all the Soul Stones.[ENTER]I should take them to Theowahdan on the new[ENTER]continent.
12458	Ahhh... yes, that's it. We can work with this.[ENTER]I'll take these Soul Stones to my clan.[ENTER]I'll be happy to tell you how it goes later on.
12459	You receive %d Blessing Scrolls.

12465	Suspicious Occurrences
12466	Theowahdan needs your help.
12467	Praise be to the Dragon God that you're here![ENTER]I need someone I can trust.
12468	My clan has been doing in-depth research for a[ENTER]long time.[ENTER]But our name has been dragged through the mud[ENTER]lately.[ENTER]Someone is going round the village and collecting[ENTER]donations, allegedly for our research.
12469	That paints us in a very bad light. Please help[ENTER]me to clear up this unfortunate situation!
12470	Alright then
12471	No way
12472	Thank you very much!
12473	Find out who has been soliciting donations using[ENTER]Theowahdan's clan's name.[ENTER]Speak to Uriel, the Old Lady and the Storekeeper.
12474	Seriously? Does my plight not bother you at all?
12475	Investigate the rumours about Theowahdan's clan.
12476	Speak to Uriel.
12477	Theowahdan's clan? Yes, I remember.[ENTER]A man dressed in the clan's colours stopped by,[ENTER]asking for donations. He was really pushy, so I[ENTER]gave him something.[ENTER]I hadn't realised how expensive the clan's[ENTER]research it...
12478	People won't trust my clan as long as that guy's[ENTER]out there collecting alleged donations. Will you[ENTER]help us?
12479	Question the villagers about Theowahdan's clan.
12480	Speak to the Old Lady.
12481	Some young fellow with a moustache came asking me[ENTER]for money. He was really rude and kind of shifty.[ENTER]I sent him packing.
12482	People won't trust my clan as long as that guy's[ENTER]out there collecting alleged donations. Will you[ENTER]help us?
12483	I've spoken to the villagers.[ENTER]Theowahdan is bound to be interested in my report.
12484	So it's true then. Someone wearing clan colours[ENTER]has been conning the villagers out of their[ENTER]money.[ENTER]Let me think about this for a moment.
12485	Speak to Theowahdan.
12486	Speak to the villagers about Theowahdan's clan.
12487	This strange guy with a fan keeps coming here and[ENTER]asking for donations.[ENTER]I gave him some money at first, but he kept[ENTER]coming back for more.[ENTER]Theowahdan's clan really has a nerve!
12488	I've spoken to the villagers.[ENTER]Now I should go and see Theowahdan.
12489	People won't trust my clan as long as that guy's[ENTER]out there collecting alleged donations. Will you[ENTER]help us?
12710	Go to the Storekeeper.
12490	Hunting Down the Trickster
12491	Speak to Theowahdan to put an end to the[ENTER]trickster's work.
12492	I still can't believe a clan member has been[ENTER]extorting money from the villagers.[ENTER]But the description you gave me matches a man I[ENTER]know.[ENTER]Will you help me?
12493	This researcher was sent to Mount Sohan.[ENTER]Go and find him.
12494	A suspicious researcher was sent to Mount Sohan.[ENTER]Find him.
12495	I should go to Mount Sohan and look for[ENTER]Theowahdan's clan member.
12496	According to Theowahdan, the researcher should be[ENTER]conducting his studies here.[ENTER]But he's not here.[ENTER]I should report this to Theowahdan in the first[ENTER]village.
12497	Meet Theowahdan in the first village.
12498	He's not there? This is bad.[ENTER]I heard that someone has been seen asking for[ENTER]donations at Cape Dragon Fire.[ENTER]Perhaps you'll find him there.
12499	Talk to the Stable Boy at Cape Dragon Fire.
12500	Talk to the Stable Boy at Cape Dragon Fire.
12501	Someone asking for donations for his research?[ENTER]Yes, I've spoken to him.[ENTER]He wouldn't let up until I gave him some of my[ENTER]hard-earned money.
12502	Oh, he's a trickster? Oh my![ENTER]He took off towards Gautama Cliff. But if you go[ENTER]after him dressed like that, he's bound to run[ENTER]off.
12503	Here, disguise yourself with this and hide your[ENTER]weapons.[ENTER]That guy's in for a big surprise!
12504	Find the trickster at Gautama Cliff.
12505	Find the trickster at Gautama Cliff and take him[ENTER]captive.
12506	Ah, aren't you from Cape Dragon Fire? Did you[ENTER]come here to bring me another donation?[ENTER][You remove the disguise.]
12507	What? Who are you? What do you want?
12508	Release him
12509	Capture him
12510	You're letting me go? Thank you very much![ENTER]I'm sure you expect something in return...
12511	I've found the trickster.[ENTER]Now head back to Theowahdan quickly on the new[ENTER]continent.
12512	Hey, let me go! I'm a member of Theowahdan's[ENTER]esteemed clan!
12513	Successfully captured
12514	I've found the trickster.[ENTER]Now head back to Theowahdan quickly on the new[ENTER]continent.
12515	Was the trickster really a member of our clan?[ENTER]How terrible![ENTER]What did you do with him?
12516	Oh... he got away?[ENTER]What a shame. I would have taught him what[ENTER]happens when people mess with us.
12517	Well, I'll at least make sure he's banished.[ENTER]Thank you for your help.
12518	I've found the trickster.[ENTER]Now head back to Theowahdan quickly on the new[ENTER]continent.
12519	You captured him?[ENTER]Excellent. I'm going to teach him a real lesson.[ENTER]And we'll banish him from the clan as well.[ENTER]Thank you for your help.
12520	You have done me a great service.
12521	Return to Theowahdan.
12522	Thanks to Theowahdan's studies, you can now carry[ENTER]new equipment: gloves

1544	I want to buy a Gold Bar.
1545	What are you talking about? I don't know anything[ENTER]about it.
1546	What? You want to buy Gold Bars? No, not now! The[ENTER]Black Wind seems to be suspicious at the moment.[ENTER]If I'm not careful, I'll risk my life! We'll try[ENTER]again once the situation has calmed down.
1547	You can't buy Gold Bars right now.
1548	I have not been able to get hold of any Gold Bars[ENTER]yet.
1549	We have to wait for %s %s.
1551	I have brought a Gold Bar with me. It costs 2,2[ENTER]million Yang. 200,000 of the Yang will be my[ENTER]payment. How about it? Are you interested?
1550	Traitor Balso:
1552	Here you are, a Gold Bar! You have made a wise[ENTER]decision. It's always a good idea to make[ENTER]investments.

1559	What? You want to sell a Gold Bar? Haven't you[ENTER]heard? The Black Wind Gang warriors are very[ENTER]suspicious at the moment and are keeping their[ENTER]eyes peeled. If you sell the Gold Bar now, you'll[ENTER]get into a lot of trouble. It would be best if[ENTER]you left it where it is. Hide it well!
1560	You cannot sell Gold Bars at the moment.
1562	If you want to bring back the Gold Bar,
1561	What? A victim of the Black Wind Gang? Ha, you're[ENTER]still a child. Where did you hear about that?[ENTER]You'd be better go and play with the wild dogs!
1563	you have to wait for about %s %s.
1564	You don't have any Gold Bars. If you give me Gold[ENTER]Bars, I'll give you Yang for them.
1565	What? You want to return your Gold Bar? Then why[ENTER]did you buy it, for God's sake? But if you want[ENTER]to return it so badly, I won't stand in your way.[ENTER]The Black Wind Gang guards their treasures very[ENTER]well; so I can't do this very often. Do you still[ENTER]want to return it?
1566	Return
1567	Don't return
1568	Here's your Yang. Damn! Now I have to return it!
1569	Do you have any Gold Bars at all? I'm very busy.[ENTER]So don't come here if you don't want to talk[ENTER]business.
1570	The 'Victim of the Black Wind Gang' mission is[ENTER]only available to players on level 30 or higher.

1573	Shh! Members of the Black Wind Gang could be[ENTER]hiding somewhere. Where did you hear about this?[ENTER]No, it's okay. It isn't that important. Do you[ENTER]know what's going on?

1626	As you wish. Just come back later.
1625	Yaholo:
1627	I think that you should work a little more on[ENTER]developing your guild. You are currently not[ENTER]strong enough for a better Altar.
1628	If your guild level increases, you will be able[ENTER]to build a bigger Altar of Power. If your guild's[ENTER]level increases, your guild becomes stronger.
1629	Hmm...your guild...
1630	Oh, now it's much stronger! I'm going to replace[ENTER]your Altar of Power with the best altar.[ENTER]You need the following materials for it:
1631	30 million Yang[ENTER]15 foundation stones[ENTER]20 planks of plywood[ENTER]20 tree trunks
1632	Good. I'm going to replace the altar with a new[ENTER]building. In doing so your guild now has the best[ENTER]possible Altar. My congratulations!
1633	There's nothing else I can do for you: your guild[ENTER]already possesses the best Altar of Power.
1634	The Altar of Power allows your guild to accept[ENTER]more members.
1635	I am Yaholo, the guard of the Altar of Power.[ENTER]This building makes it possible for your guild to[ENTER]accept more members. When your guild gets[ENTER]stronger, you can build a bigger Altar and then[ENTER]be able to invite even more members.
1636	Hmm... your guild ...
1637	Its power has clearly grown. Do you want to[ENTER]replace the current Altar of Power with a bigger[ENTER]one? If so, you need the following materials:
1638	25 million Yang[ENTER]10 foundation stones[ENTER]15 planks of plywood[ENTER]10 tree trunks
1639	Replace the Altar of Power
1640	Don't replace the Altar of Power
1641	Good. I'm going to replace it with a new building.
1642	The construction of the Altar is not cheap: I[ENTER]require a considerable amount of building[ENTER]materials and Yang. If you cannot provide me with[ENTER]these things, then I cannot help you. Come back[ENTER]when you have everything!
1644	That is not the necessary item.
1643	A diamond can be made from 100 diamond stones.
1645	Congratulations - your refinement has been[ENTER]successful. You now have:

2027	Heuk-Young:
2028	Do you really want to leave the grotto of exile?
2029	A wise decision. It's too dangerous to stay here[ENTER]any longer. Go and tend to your wounds first.
2030	You're very brave. Good luck in the depths of[ENTER]that horrible place...
2031	Seon-Hae
2032	In the Grotto
2033	Listen carefully, my boy! I'm only going to tell[ENTER]you this story once...
2034	Listen carefully, my girl! I'm only going to tell[ENTER]you this story once...
2035	Nowadays we worship the Dragon God, but once upon[ENTER]a time, three gods watched over us. However,[ENTER]Bahar-Taraji, the Goddess of Creation, was[ENTER]murdered by her jealous brother Beran-Setaou. And[ENTER]the third God, Baljit-Elvedin, who we know today[ENTER]as the Dragon God, went into deep mourning for[ENTER]his sister.
2036	A battle broke out between the two brothers,[ENTER]which the Dragon God won. Rumour has it, that[ENTER]traces of the battle can still be found at the[ENTER]site of their altercation. Beran-Setaou was[ENTER]locked in a cave after his defeat, which then[ENTER]became known as the Grotto of Exile.
2037	This grotto is sealed and guarded by members of[ENTER]Baljit-Elvedin's order. You have to hand over a[ENTER]Blood Stone to be allowed through. I know how to[ENTER]produce those stones, but it's not easy.
2038	It all began with the tears that the Dragon God[ENTER]cried over his sister, which then became stones[ENTER]that fell onto the earth. You can still find them[ENTER]in the Fireland of Doyyumhwan today. Get seven of[ENTER]these tears and four pieces of Obsidian from the[ENTER]Flames that live there and bring them to me.
2039	Collect 7 Fossilised Tears and 4 pieces of[ENTER]Obsidian in Doyyumhwan.
2040	You need another Blood Stone to get past the[ENTER]Guard of the Order? Then collect another seven[ENTER]Fossilised Tears and four pieces of Obsidian in[ENTER]the Fireland of Doyyumhwan.
2041	You need another Blood Stone? Koe-Pung isn't the[ENTER]cleverest, but you should wait a little,[ENTER]otherwise he might notice that you don't belong[ENTER]to his order.
2042	A few hours, I would say: %s
2043	One hour and %s minutes.
2044	Wait another %s minutes.
2045	Fossilised Tear
2046	Here's one of the Dragon God's Fossilised Tears[ENTER]that has fallen onto the earth.
2047	Take the tear
2048	Carry on searching for tears here
2049	Do nothing
2050	You have received a Fossilised Tear.
2051	Fossilised Tear
2052	You decide to try looking for more tears and[ENTER]find: %s
2053	The creatures in the area are paying attention to[ENTER]you now!
2054	Go to the Fireland of Doyyumhwan and look for[ENTER]Baljit Elvedin, the Dragon God's, Fossilised[ENTER]Tears. You should also collect Obsidian, by[ENTER]killing Flames.
2055	Fossilised Tears required: %s
2056	Obsidian required: %s
2057	You have collected enough tears!
2058	You found Obsidian by this flame!
2059	You have collected all the required Obsidian!
2060	Go back to Seon-Hae with the Fossilised Tears and[ENTER]the Obsidian.
2061	Seon-Hae is in: %s
2062	Baljit-Elvedin's tears! I'll transform them back[ENTER]into their liquid form and put them inside the[ENTER]Obsidian. Their power allows you to call the[ENTER]Goddess Bahar-Taraji!
2063	Her spirit still wanders the earth. Her voice[ENTER]will talk to you when you carry the tears with[ENTER]you. Look for her in the Red Forest of Lungsam!
2064	Here, take this vase and look for Bahar-Taraji's[ENTER]voice.
2065	Look for Bahar-Taraji's voice in the area of the[ENTER]Red Forest in Lungsam. Even if you can't see the[ENTER]goddess' ghost, you will be able to feel her[ENTER]spirit's presence.
2066	A quiet sound of whispering whistles through the[ENTER]wind: Go to a safe place... We can't talk here...[ENTER]Click on the quest scroll to talk to the ghost.
2067	The murdered Goddess Bahar-Taraji's voice sounds[ENTER]in the distance...
2068	My brother's tears... he grieved for me for so[ENTER]long and yet he still couldn't punish[ENTER]Beran-Setaou for his deeds.
2069	He couldn't confront his brother Beran-Setaou,[ENTER]the destroyer, the one that the people feared.
2070	But you... Who are you? You're different![ENTER]You're not afraid of him. On the contrary, I can[ENTER]see that you're seeking combat.
2071	%s! Take these drops of my blood. Produce a Blood[ENTER]Stone with it and make Beran-Setaou pay for his[ENTER]deeds. The Grotto of Exile isn't far from here.
2072	In the distance, the voice of the murdered[ENTER]Goddess Bahar-Taraji sounds...
2073	%s! I recognise you!
2074	You have brought my brother's tears to console me[ENTER]and will therefore receive my blood as a reward,[ENTER]so that you can carry on fighting.
2075	Go back to Seon-Hae with Bahar-Taraji's blood.
2076	Seon-Hae's eyes become glassy as she takes the[ENTER]Drops of Blood from you...
2077	The blood of a real Goddess! Quick, let me make[ENTER]it into a Blood Stone before it dries up.
2078	The guard Koe-Pung will let you use the portal[ENTER]that leads to the Grotto of Exile if you have a[ENTER]Blood Stone on you. However, it'll only work[ENTER]once. If you need more blood stones, then come[ENTER]back to see me. Unfortunately I can only produce[ENTER]a Blood Stone once a day, so that we don't[ENTER]attract the Order's Wrath.
2079	Seon-Hae can produce more Blood Stones for you,[ENTER]but only one per day.
2080	I'm going to turn Bahar-Taraji's blood into a[ENTER]Blood Stone. May it serve you well.
2081	I can only make you one Blood Stone a day.[ENTER]Otherwise Koe-Pung might become suspicious.

2089	Voucher for a Horse Medal
2090	Stable Boy:
2091	In former times, a voucher like this was needed[ENTER]to receive a Horse Medal. You can exchange it for[ENTER]one. Would you like to use your voucher now?
2092	Exchange
2093	I gave you a Horse Medal.
2094	Information about horses
2095	To start a horse mission, you need a Horse Medal.[ENTER]You can get one in the monkey dungeon.
2096	There are horses for three levels of riders:[ENTER]beginner, intermediate and expert.[ENTER]When you have practised enough and want to get to[ENTER]the next level, you have to pass a test.
2097	Depending on the individual pressures put on[ENTER]horses by their riders, horses need different[ENTER]types of food. Riding beginners should feed their[ENTER]animals with hay, advanced riders should feed[ENTER]their animals with carrots and expert riders that[ENTER]demand a lot from their horses, should only feed[ENTER]their horses with red Ginseng. When it comes to[ENTER]food, horses can be very picky.
2098	The condition of your horse is shown by means of[ENTER]a simple indicator: Green means that it is[ENTER]healthy, yellow means it is hungry. Red is[ENTER]dangerous, as it means that your horse is[ENTER]undernourished. You have to feed your horse if[ENTER]the indicator is yellow or red. It is a serious[ENTER]business if your horse dies.
2099	When you ride your horse, it's health slowly[ENTER]depletes and it becomes exhausted. You can't ride[ENTER]a horse without health. Therefore, you have to[ENTER]let it rest occasionally.
2100	There are rumours going round that a dead horse[ENTER]can be revived with Monkey Herbs. However the[ENTER]herbs are strictly guarded by monkeys, and it[ENTER]seems to be difficult to get hold of them. Rumour[ENTER]has it that if you are caught by the monkeys,[ENTER]they will curse you, and you'll be transformed[ENTER]into one of them.
2101	A rider's skills can vary a lot. If you have a[ENTER]Horse Medal, you can improve the level of your[ENTER]mount.
2103	Kill the Black Orc while riding your horse. If[ENTER]you get off your horse, you will fail.
2102	Kill Bo!
2104	Kill the Dark Tormentor!
11867	Remaining: %s

2123	Your horse is very hungry. Go feed it.
2125	Ride over to me.
2124	Kill Chuong!
2126	Attacking while riding is much more difficult[ENTER]than simply riding. But the same rules apply[ENTER]here: Practice makes perfect. If you fall down,[ENTER]you fail. So be careful! Your results will be[ENTER]recorded on your Horse Medal.
2127	Get a Horse Medal!
2128	You need a Horse Medal in order to learn how to[ENTER]fight on the back of a horse. You can get one in[ENTER]the monkey dungeon.
2129	Attacking while riding has failed
2130	You have fallen off your horse or have[ENTER]dismounted. You therefore have not completed your[ENTER]mission.
2131	Return to the Stable Boy
2132	If you go back to the Stable Boy, you can check[ENTER]your results on the Horse Medal.
2133	Did everything work out? Your training will[ENTER]continue tomorrow. Today's results have been[ENTER]recorded on your Horse Medal.

2175	You can only revive the horse if you get Herbs of[ENTER]Easy Monkeys from the beginners Monkey Dungeon.[ENTER]But this isn't an easy mission, as the herbs are[ENTER]guarded by the monkeys that live there. And those[ENTER]monkeys are incredibly aggressive.
2176	For your information: the Herbs of Normal Monkeys[ENTER]from the normal Monkey Dungeon are only for[ENTER]intermediate horses.
2177	These are Herbs of Easy Monkeys from the[ENTER]beginners Monkey Dungeon. Your horse can be[ENTER]revived with them. You have to call it first[ENTER]though.
2178	You can only revive the horse if you get Herbs of[ENTER]Hard Monkeys from the expert Monkey Dungeon. But[ENTER]don't be fooled into thinking that is going to be[ENTER]a walk in the park. The herbs are guarded by the[ENTER]monkeys that live there. And those monkeys are[ENTER]incredibly aggressive.
2179	For your information: the Herbs of Normal Monkeys[ENTER]from the normal Monkey Dungeon are for[ENTER]intermediate horses.

2183	The horse has been revived. Don't forget to feed[ENTER]your horse in the future.
2184	You can only revive the horse if you get Herbs of[ENTER]Normal Monkeys from the normal Monkey Dungeon.[ENTER]But don't be fooled into thinking that this is[ENTER]going to be a walk in the park. The herbs are[ENTER]guarded by the monkeys that live there. And those[ENTER]monkeys are incredibly aggressive.
2185	For your information: the Herbs of Hard Monkeys[ENTER]from the expert Monkey Dungeon are for horses[ENTER]that belong to expert riders.
2186	Mount (use the Horse Riding Ticket)
2187	You can rent a horse here. Come back if you want[ENTER]to rent one.
2188	You're looking for a mount? At the moment we are[ENTER]renting out horses to people that have Horse[ENTER]Riding Tickets. Your current riding skills will[ENTER]allow you to ride a horse for about 10 minutes.[ENTER]You do not have much riding experience, so you[ENTER]can keep steady on a horse, but cannot attack[ENTER]from horseback yet.
2189	Don't ride

2230	Wait for the Armed Horse Book
2231	Wait for the Stable Boy to finish the Armed Horse[ENTER]Book.
2233	Is the Armed Horse Book finished yet?
2232	Your level is too low to improve your horse. You[ENTER]can only improve your horse once you have reached[ENTER]level 35. Come again when you're ready.
2234	I am sorry, but you will have to wait a little[ENTER]bit longer. Remember to bring the 500,000 Yang[ENTER]when you come back!
2235	Go to the Stable Boy and get the Armed Horse[ENTER]Book. You will need your Horse Picture and[ENTER]500,000 Yang to get it.
2236	Go to the Stable Boy and get the Armed Horse[ENTER]Book. You need your Horse Picture and 500,000[ENTER]Yang to get it.

2240	You need the Horse Picture to get the Armed Horse[ENTER]Book.
2241	You also need 500,000 Yang.
2242	Come again if you want the Armed Horse Book.
2244	Are you sure? If you discontinue the quest now,[ENTER]you will have to do it from scratch.
2243	The level of your horse is too low to improve it.[ENTER]Go train your horsemanship. Once your horse[ENTER]reaches level 10, you can come again.
2245	As you have not killed 100 Scorpion Archers or[ENTER]Snake Archers you haven't passed the test.
2246	I don't want to have to say this again: If you[ENTER]want to ride a horse, you need to have your Horse[ENTER]Picture with you!
2247	If you own the Armed Horse Book, you can attack[ENTER]your opponents from the back of your horse. I'm[ENTER]going to test your combat experience and your[ENTER]horsemanship. Go to the desert and kill some[ENTER]Scorpion Archers. You can go there with a group,[ENTER]but YOU have to be the group leader.
2248	Okay, come back later.

2250	I can't think of a reason why you shouldn't have[ENTER]received the Armed Horse Book. Perhaps you should[ENTER]consult a Game Master.
2251	You need a Horse Medal to start the quest for the[ENTER]Armed Horse Book. You can find it in the monkey[ENTER]dungeon.

2258	Kill 300 Demon Archers within 30 minutes and[ENTER]report back to the Stable Boy.
2259	You can travel in a group and enjoy support in[ENTER]battle. But remember that only the group leader[ENTER]will be credited with the results.
2260	About the Military Horse Book...
2261	Kill 300 Demon Archers! You have 30 minutes to[ENTER]complete the mission.[ENTER][ENTER]You can work in a group for extra protection, but[ENTER]you need to be the group leader if you want the[ENTER]results to count.
2262	Are you sure you want to discontinue the test?
2263	Yes.
2264	No, just kidding!
2266	All right. Good luck next time.
2265	What's the point of improving a dead horse?[ENTER]Apart from anything else, it won't work. Go find[ENTER]some Monkey Herbs, which can bring your horse[ENTER]back to life. Afterwards we can then talk about[ENTER]the possibility of improving your horse.
2267	If you want to pass the test you don't have any[ENTER]time to hang around here! Go kill the Demon[ENTER]Archers!

2273	Well done! If you want to improve your horse now,[ENTER]you need to exchange your Armed Horse Book for[ENTER]the Military Horse Book. It will also cost you[ENTER]1,000,000 Yang. It's going to take some time to[ENTER]finish the book, so come again tomorrow.
2274	Wait for the Military Horse Book
2275	Wait for the Stable Boy to finish the Military[ENTER]Horse Book.
2277	Status horse improvement
2276	Your level is too low to improve your horse. You[ENTER]can only improve your horse once you have reached[ENTER]level 50. Just come back when you're ready.
2278	Is the Military Horse Book finished yet?
2279	I'm sorry, you need to wait a little longer.[ENTER]Ahhhh yes, don't forget: you need 1,000,000 Yang[ENTER]for the Military Horse Book.
2280	Go to the Stable Boy
2281	Go to the Stable Boy and pick up your Military[ENTER]Horse Book. You need your Armed Horse Book and[ENTER]1,000,000 Yang to get it.
2282	I want to collect the Military Horse Book.
2283	If you have the Military Horse Book, your horse[ENTER]will be able to master different fighting styles.[ENTER]A book like this is very rare, and it is not very[ENTER]cheap either. You need 1,000,000 Yang to buy one.[ENTER]Do you really want to improve your horse?
2284	Improve horse
2285	Don't improve horse
2286	Oh, whatever. Forget it.
2287	Once you have the Military Horse Book, you can[ENTER]call your horse any time and it'll come to you.[ENTER]So, take good care of it. These are the basics;[ENTER]now it's up to you.
2289	You need the Armed Horse Book to get the Military[ENTER]Horse Book.
2288	Your horse's level is too low to improve it. Go[ENTER]train your riding skills. Come back once your[ENTER]horse has reached level 20.
2290	You haven't got 1,000,000 Yang on you.
2291	Come back if you want to get the Military Horse[ENTER]Book.
2292	Are you sure? If you give up now, you'll have to[ENTER]start the quest from scratch.
2293	Time's up!
2294	You haven't killed 300 Demon Archers so you[ENTER]haven't passed the test!
2295	If you want to try again, get another Horse Medal[ENTER]and go visit the Stable Boy.
2296	If you want to improve your horse, you need to[ENTER]pass a qualification test. Just like last time,[ENTER]you need a Horse Medal to be able to take the[ENTER]test. You can find it in the monkey dungeon. Of[ENTER]course, the monkeys living there won't give it to[ENTER]you without a fight and they're very violent...
2297	Do I really have to say it again? If you want to[ENTER]ride a horse, you need to have the Armed Horse[ENTER]Book with you.
2298	Only the strongest in the world will get the[ENTER]Military Horse Book. Go to the Demon Tower and[ENTER]kill 300 Demon Archers. If you manage to do this,[ENTER]no-one will be able to stop me from giving you[ENTER]the Military Horse Book. Of course, it's a hard[ENTER]assignment. You can do it with a group, but YOU[ENTER]need to be the group leader.
2299	Well then, come back later.
2300	I can't think of a reason why you haven't[ENTER]received the Military Horse Book. (Ask a game[ENTER]master about it).

11139	Oh! What shall I do?
11140	I need to get my hands on him.
11141	But he's too quick to catch.
11142	It's so frustrating...
11143	What are you worried about?
11144	A stranger has been causing me problems recently.
11145	But he's so fast, I can never catch him.
11146	There have been rumours going around lately as[ENTER]well.
11147	What rumours?
11148	Although the land is divided into three kingdoms,[ENTER]the Yongbi Desert belongs to us.
11149	
11150	But mysterious messages from across the sea have[ENTER]been going around.
11151	They claim the desert belongs to them.
11152	Aha. Maybe I can help?
11153	This man is walking around the town in disguise,[ENTER]spreading rumours.
11154	
11155	If you can bring me proof of his death, you'll be[ENTER]rewarded.
11156	I'll get him.
11157	I'm not exactly quick on my feet.
11158	Oh, thank you! His name is Tanaka.
11159	I'll scour the town.
11160	Bring me his ear!
11161	Hmm... wherever he is, it's the land which counts.
11162	That's how I see it...
11163	What should we do for the future of the kingdom?
11164	Why don't you kill Tanaka?
11165	Tanaka, who's spreading rumours in my country.
11166	Kill him.
11167	Take Tanaka's Ear and deliver it to Yonah.
11168	Ask about Tanaka.
11169	Tanaka's getting away. Oh...
11170	It'd be almost impossible to catch him in heavy[ENTER]armour.
11171	I think some improved armour is in order.
11172	Oh, what happened?
11173	Continue
11174	Give up
11175	Do you really want to give up?
11176	Hmm... doesn't look like you'll manage.
11177	Thanks for your hard work.
11178	By the way, he's got something shiny in his[ENTER]hands. He's doing his best to hide it, but I[ENTER]caught a glimpse.
11179	I can't catch Tanaka.
11180	I'm going to give up.
11181	I appreciate your hard work...
11182	I'm not exactly out for compensation.
11183	I simply love my country...
11184	I want to give up and start again.
11185	I'll do it.
11186	Again, I'm not expecting any kind of reward.
11187	Here, Tanaka's Ear.
11188	Oh, you managed to catch him!
11189	Now then, my country, other countries...
11190	I'm worried about lineages and nations...
11191	The land may be divided now, but this part[ENTER]belongs to us.
11192	
11193	Hmm...
11194	Thanks for your efforts.
11195	I want to give you a little something in reward.[ENTER]Here you go.

10933	Hard work never hurt anyone.
10934	I can barely bring myself to tell you this.
10935	It's strange to hear you talking about hard work.
10936	You look like a beggar.
10937	Ha! A beggar? You shouldn't go judging a book by[ENTER]its cover.
10938	I simply don't put great store in swanky clothes[ENTER]or fancy food.
10939	But I work just as hard as anyone else!
10940	How dare you go calling me a beggar?
10941	My apologies...
10942	I feel rather awkward causing you so many[ENTER]problems when we've only just met...
10943	I'll help where I can...
10944	I could do with some help.
10945	Hmm. First I need to test your abilities.
10946	Kill 20 Wild Dogs.
10947	I don't understand what you want.
10948	It's not that difficult...
10949	Go on, go hunt some Wild Dogs!
10950	Ignore it.
10951	Find the Shabby Pedestrian
10952	Receive a reward for your hard work from the[ENTER]Shabby Pedestrian.
10953	
10954	I've completed my mission.
10955	Hey, great.
10956	In actual fact, I'm head of the Labour Office.
10957	I work on the quiet, granting rewards to hard[ENTER]workers.
10958	
10959	This stays our little secret, okay?
10960	Enjoy the rest of the month!

10977	The Shabby Pedestrian's First Test
10978	As a result of your little mistake when talking[ENTER]to the Shabby Pedestrian, you accepted the quest[ENTER]to kill 20 Wild Dogs.
10979	
10980	
10981	Kill 20 Wild Dogs.
10982	Remaining:
10983	I have killed all 20 Wild Dogs.
10984	It's a long time since I last hunted so many Wild[ENTER]Dogs.
10985	But who knows what he's giving me these tests[ENTER]for...
10986	Ah well, maybe I'll find out when I go back to[ENTER]him.
10987	Ask about the quest.
10988	Kill the Wild Dogs first.
10989	Hmm... too easy for you?
10990	Ah well. Reminds me of my youth.
10991	I was a really honest young man.
10992	(Why on earth is he telling me this...)
10993	Aaah, you look nervous!
10994	Or is my mission too easy for you?
10995	What about a few boars then?
10996	Great! Now off you go!
10997	Get a move on!
10998	Time is running out without you noticing.
10999	It seems you've been busy.
11000	Farewell then.
11001	The Shabby Pedestrian's Second Test
11002	Since I behaved so badly to the Shabby[ENTER]Pedestrian, I've been given the mission to hunt[ENTER]down Wild Dogs.
11003	
11004	Now he's suggested I also kill some Wild Boars.
11005	And I presume the confused look on my face leads[ENTER]him to think I'll actually do it.
11006	
11007	What a day...
11008	Kill 30 Wild Boars.
11009	Remaining:
11010	Wild Boar Mission Complete
11011	Even little kids can kill boars.
11012	Complete the mission quickly and come back here.
11013	Hmm... I'm surprised. I thought you'd manage it[ENTER]quicker.
11014	It seems you aren't as good as you think.
11015	Once you kill 50 Bears, I'll acknowledge your[ENTER]skills. Final chance.
11016	Complete the mission quickly and come back here.
11017	How dare you talk to me like that?
11018	Killing bears is child's play!
11019	By the way, this guy's getting ever more[ENTER]demanding.
11020	No, I won't! No, I won't!
11021	The Shabby Pedestrian's Third Test
11022	What a fortunate twist of fate!
11023	I accepted the Wild Dog and Wild Boar missions to[ENTER]make up for my little slip up. And now he wants[ENTER]bears.
11024	
11025	This is the final test. Hopefully.
11026	I'll complete it quickly.
11027	Kill 50 Bears.
11028	Remaining:
11029	I've killed all the bears.
11030	So, it's finally over.
11031	Time to say goodbye to that beggar!
11032	Err... the Shabby Pedestrian.
11033	Killing bears is child's play!
11034	Yes, that's true.
11035	Good. Very good. That's definitely a rumour.
11036	Forget about the boars.
11037	I wanted to tell you about something that's going[ENTER]on in town.
11038	That business with the gangs.
11039	We knew who the gang members were, however...
11040	Did they destroy anything valuable?
11041	Or what happened?
11042	Haha, a true warrior isn't interested in personal[ENTER]feelings like that.
11043	
11044	I only want peace for the kingdom, but they're[ENTER]not interested.
11045	
11046	He may look shabby, but he's a brave man.
11047	I think he's being facetious.
11048	Right! That's enough!
11049	Stop it.
11050	The Shabby Pedestrian's Test: White Oath Soldiers
11051	It's been a good while since I received a mission[ENTER]from the Shabby Pedestrian.
11052	After a long test, he asked me to kill White Oath[ENTER]Soldiers and Black Wind Soldiers.
11053	
11054	He seems to have a personal connection to them.
11055	I've decided to carry out the mission.
11056	Defeat 100 White Oath Soldiers.
11057	Rich rewards await you at the end of this mission.
11058	Please have patience!

2388	Go back to Soon.
2389	Return to the village and tell Soon that you[ENTER]couldn't find the Milgyo book.
2390	Return to the village.
2391	I seem to be followed by misfortune - I just[ENTER]can't find the Milgyo book. The only thing that[ENTER]is left to do is to go back to the village.
2392	Get the Milgyo book for Soon!
2393	Get the Milgyo book for Soon!
2394	Return to the village, give the book to Soon and[ENTER]get your reward.
2395	Here it is...the Milgyo book!
2396	There's the Milgyo book! Take it to Soon in the[ENTER]village.
2397	Which fool got this strange book for my husband?[ENTER]He's been staring at it the whole day, learning[ENTER]strange chants off by heart. He doesn't lift a[ENTER]finger anymore! I'll break every one of his bones[ENTER]when I get my hands on him!
2398	What's wrong? What's with the cold sweat on your[ENTER]forehead?
2399	Where did he go now? His attitude is getting on[ENTER]my nerves! He wastes his days reading books[ENTER]without earning a single Yang. And he's not even[ENTER]ashamed of the fact that he's such a bad role[ENTER]model for his children.
2400	Can books put food on your table or get clothes[ENTER]for you? I'll break all his bones when I get hold[ENTER]of him!
2401	Talk.
2402	Oha! Yes, I see it! I see it! I can see the new[ENTER]world!
2403	Did you find the Milgyo book?
2404	Did you mean this book?
2405	He came here yesterday and asked about the Milgyo[ENTER]book. He didn't have any Yang, but he asked about[ENTER]it constantly anyway. Maybe Milgyo has got[ENTER]something to do with these brual creatures in the[ENTER]Valley of Seungryong. Dunno why he has developed[ENTER]a sudden interest in those creatures though.
2406	You just have to feel sorry for Aranyo. Why does[ENTER]she put up with him?
2407	About Soon the academic
2408	Okay! I'm going to get it for you!
2409	Thanks! I'm counting on you.
2410	Kill the disciple of Milgyo!
2411	Kill Milgyo's disciple!
2412	Take the Milgyo book from Milgyo's disciple.
2413	That should be rather difficult.
2414	Why don't you give it a try? I know you can do it!
2415	Do you want to hear something funny? I can[ENTER]actually claim that I've read all books in this[ENTER]world! Right now, I am studying a collection of[ENTER]holy texts. Rumour has it, that secret[ENTER]information and hints about how to become a saint[ENTER]may be found in the Milgyo book.
2416	I would like to read this book. What do you[ENTER]think, could you get it for me? I would, of[ENTER]course, reward you!
2417	Someone else has already brought me the Milgyo[ENTER]book. You don't need to do it any more.
2418	Go to Soon.
2419	Go to Soon.

2491	I am Thorr Sarch! What do you want from me? I'm[ENTER]not dead, I will come back to life. Legions of[ENTER]warriors will follow me![ENTER]You have ended the kingdom battle. Everyone will[ENTER]be transported back to the village.
2492	Take part in the Kingdom Battle
2493	A new area has been discovered. It is in the[ENTER]middle of the continent - it may even connect all[ENTER]the kingdoms together. It's swarming with dark[ENTER]creatures. Perhaps you could go there and[ENTER]confront them? Destroy them all and restore peace[ENTER]to our kingdom.
2494	Hey! A new area has been discovered at the inner[ENTER]part of the continent. It may even connect all[ENTER]the kingdoms. As soon as the research is done[ENTER]there, you can enter the area.

2498	Rules of the Kingdom Battle:[ENTER]1. The kingdom with the lowest number of[ENTER]victories against another kingdom is eliminated[ENTER]first.[ENTER]2. Enemy monsters are going to appear. The first[ENTER]kingdom to slay a certain number of monsters[ENTER]wins.[ENTER]3. If the Nine Tails is killed after that, the[ENTER]battle ends.[ENTER]4. No items can be obtained during the battle.[ENTER]5. Whoever dies three times in the Holy Land[ENTER]returns to the village and is eliminated from the[ENTER]Kingdom Battle.
2499	Fortune has truly taken a shine to you! Today you[ENTER]will have 'Very Good Fortune'! Those protected by[ENTER]such harmony will have something good happen to[ENTER]them today.
2500	Very good fortune!

2502	Great fortune!
2503	That's not bad. Today, you will have 'Some Good[ENTER]Luck'. Your day is going to go a little better[ENTER]than usual but don't expect great gifts!
2504	A bit of fortune.
2505	Nothing particularly good, but nothing too bad[ENTER]either! You will have 'normal luck' today. It[ENTER]won't really help you any further, but it is[ENTER]better than having misfortune. Normal days are[ENTER]not to be sneezed at so enjoy!
2506	Normal fortune.
2507	You will not be very lucky today. Even if you[ENTER]throw out your nets as conscientiously as ever,[ENTER]you will not catch many fish today. On the plus[ENTER]side, you will not starve. You will have 'a bit[ENTER]of bad luck' today! But there's nothing better[ENTER]than being well prepared. If you like, I can sell[ENTER]you a talisman which can help you to avert very[ENTER]bad luck. Are you interested?
2508	A bit of misfortune.
2509	Today is a bad day. A day when even doing your[ENTER]best will get you almost nothing. Today, you have[ENTER]'Bad Luck' and have to be careful where you go[ENTER]and what you do. I could, however, help you and[ENTER]sell you a talisman so that you can avoid the[ENTER]worst.[ENTER]Are you interested?
2510	Misfortune.
2511	This is going to be one of the worst days in your[ENTER]life. All gods in heaven and on earth have turned[ENTER]their backs on you. Nothing is going to work out[ENTER]for you today. If you want to start a fire, it[ENTER]will rain; if you are thirsty, the sun will burn[ENTER]down on you. You will work just as hard as[ENTER]everyone else, but you will not reap any rewards[ENTER]for it. You are going to suffer 'really bad[ENTER]luck'![ENTER]Without a talisman, you will have a tough time.[ENTER]Are you interested in buying one?

2773	Look at you! Weak and slow...
2774	Your body and your soul are mine!
2775	Your legs are shaking! Just face it, you're not up to this...
2776	How much longer will you be able to handle this?
2777	Who could have ever guessed that there is something worse than death?

2876	Being in a frozen state is good... for me!
2877	I'm sure that Mount Sohan is the best place!
2878	What nice weather.
2879	At the end you will be just as cold as me...
2880	You can live forever, at least until the ice melts.
2881	How do you think it will feel, when you slowly turn into a piece of ice?
2882	Humans...here?!
2883	Tired...but awake enough for you...
2884	Anybody here, on my hill? 
2885	You don't belong here!
2886	You'd better back off!
2887	Stranger... so lonely?
2888	It's been a long time since we've seen an experienced fighter around here.
2889	Nothing else to do but to wait and polish weapons...
2890	Should I work on them?
2891	
2892	Something is missing. I am not amused...
2893	I'm going to put quick end to your pain - and it's the last pain you'll ever feel!
2894	A longneck...!
2895	Your pale skin is going to get even paler in a minute.
2896	You want to challenge me? Fine!
2897	You attacked me! You won't survive this!
2898	Weak, weak human!
2899	Let's see how much you can bear!
2900	Got away? Don't even think about it.
2901	That's right... comes closer!
2902	The sword is shaking in my hand...
2903	You won't survive this encounter!
2904	Here comes my sword!
2905	Painful, isn't it?
2906	Even the grass that you're walking on might kill you.
2907	I would be careful if I were you...
2908	That's right. Come closer...
2909	You dare to come near me? Well... then you can live with the consequences!
2910	It's time for you say goodbye to the world!
2911	Do you regret that you came?
2912	Who thinks that they can defeat me?
2913	You? You want to fight against me?
2914	Attack me, if you dare to!
2915	You're not thinking of running away, are you?
2916	You have underestimated the coverage of my sword.
2917	Are you afraid?
2918	I think you're going to die at my hands today.
2919	Oh, I like you.
2920	Ah, so you want to bring a little bit of variety into my life?
2921	Hey! It won't help you to run away like a coward.
2922	Has the look of me already made a shiver run down your spine?
2923	Don't you want to scream a little?
2924	You seem to be nervous... Don't worry, nothing is going to explode.
2925	Sometimes, I just want to go for a stroll.
2926	Time is going by so slowly... My grandchildren don't even visit me any more.
2927	When you get old, you often don't have much company.
2928	My best days are over.
2929	The sun is so hot.
2930	Wonderful weather to dry laundry, isn't it?
2931	Where is that lazy good-for-nothing husband?
2932	He's not even ashamed that his children know about laziness! And he calls himself a father...
2933	Books, always books! He doesn't go to work and doesn't bring any Yang home. He just reads the whole time!
2934	Hello little one, did you sleep well?
2935	My little angel.
2936	You are my sunshine...
2937	What's wrong? Are you hungry?
2938	That's right... go to sleep, my little one.
2939	Just another day...
2940	Where am I going to get food today?
2941	It is always the same thing with those sword bearers.
2942	Let's see. Maybe I should go to Octavio's restaurant.
2943	Oh, by the way, the war seems to be over...
2944	The soul of a master potter runs through his fingertips.
2945	Ever since the country was submerged into chaos, fighters can be found everywhere.
2946	Fights, fights everywhere.
2947	I pray for a calm and a peaceful world.
2948	Why the hurry? Take a moment to relax and think.
2949	Oh my, what should I do?
2950	I can't find my brother anywhere, but he did promise to meet me here.
2951	And now, all I see here are armed warriors.
2952	I miss my brother.
2953	Has anyone seen my brother?
2954	Ha, this meat is really fresh!
2955	It's good that people are eating more meat again now.
2956	Business is doing great, but meat is still scarce.
2957	When is the meat we ordered going to arrive?
2958	If it doesn't arrive on time, we'll have to go hunting.
2959	I hope the customers will come in swarms when the weather is this nice.
2960	The lazy dog will probably come around soon and he'll want something to eat.
2961	Poor guy!
2962	He used to be a great warrior.
2963	I wonder why he doesn't fight any more?
2964	The young guys... so lively and full of beans!
2965	Warriors look much more impressive when they are carrying weapons.
2966	A murderous mind is something everyone has nowadays.
2967	Control your heart, focus your thoughts, and calm your soul.
2968	There is no infallible recipe for bliss but some simple guidelines you can stick to.
2969	Here, this is a very useful item!
2970	Goods from distant countries! Beautiful, extraordinary pieces!
2971	Come closer everyone!
2972	Come on, people, buy! You won't have this chance again!
2973	There are too many thieves around here. They should keep away from my goods!
2974	The land has been very dry in the last few years.
2975	The grain harvest isn't as good as it used to be.
2976	I wonder why the seeds are wasting away on the fields.
2977	The grain is brittle and tastes rotten.
2978	That's a bad sign. Farming is the foundation of our lives.
2979	Rice cakes! Delicious rice cakes!
2980	I sell sweet rice cakes!
2981	Yeah, business has been pretty bad lately.
2982	Maybe I should try it in another city.
2983	But there are so many wild predators around here...
2984	On days like these, being in a boat is the best thing that can happen to you.
2985	Perfect weather for fishing.
2986	Now another knot... Right! No fish is going to bite off this hook!
2987	That damn bear ruined my fishing pole.
2988	I should mend my nets again.
2989	Huh!
2990	Don't worry about me; that's just how I am.
2991	Ha!
2992	What should I do so they ... Oh my, what did I say just now?
2993	I'm just not brave enough.
2994	This axe has served me well for 20 years.
2995	Still sharp, though maybe not as good as it used to be.
2996	I want to carry on using it, so it needs to be sharpened.
2997	I need special mineral stones for that.
2998	But where can I get them from?
2999	The customers are coming in swarms.
3000	I hope I finish everything in time.
3001	Blow on blow and no complaining...
3002	This is what a hammer must sound like!
3003	Quite hot here.
3004	I'm not in the mood for music.
3005	My instrument is in a really bad shape.
3006	Perhaps I should get a new instrument?
3007	My instrument is old and worn... I love old things!
3008	I urgently need to find a replacement for the torn strings.
3009	I'm so busy!
3010	Every day more wounded people arrive here.
3011	There's no time for private amusement!
3012	And we're running out of medicine.
3013	We need someone who can get hold of some ingredients for the medicine.
3014	For 30 years, I have been wandering through the mountains with my bow.
3015	I supported my wife with this and have raised three children.
3016	It's a hard life but worth it.
3017	But now, the bowstring has ripped and I can't hunt any more. I can't feed my family like this!
3018	If I can't repair this bow, I'll have to buy a new one. But I don't have enough money to do that.
3019	Hey, what are you staring at?
3020	Stay away from me!
3021	How long will I have to keep hiding?
3022	Dying alone and forgotten by the rest of the world is not really what I want.
3023	Someone has to help me!
3024	This day is going to end just like any other day.
3025	What can I do now?
3026	I never thought it would end like this.
3027	I still can't believe that he's not here any more.
3028	He didn't deserve that.
3029	Another great day.
3030	Ariyoung's husband has disappeared.
3031	I wanted to help, but this stubbornness...
3032	If she had married me, she could have left her boring life behind.
3033	Maybe I should have expressed my feelings for her better.
3034	Oh no! What should I do if my wife finds out?
3035	If only I could just live from reading books!
3036	Every book leads you into its own, mysterious world.
3037	I know that I can't live like this forever, but...
3038	I wish I could change it for my wife, but...
3039	Come on, put some effort into it!
3040	What are you doing? Can't you hurry up a little more?
3041	Just picture a warrior raising his sword and do the same!
3042	Where is that fool now?
3043	You want to be a man?
3044	Cut, cut... hair, throats...
3045	I have something for you: eternal sleep!
3046	Take a deep breath. Don't worry, it's only poison!
3047	I'll only leave your face! That'll make a nice decoration...
3048	
3049	Wrapped up in silk you'll make a nice appetiser for later...
3050	There aren't many of us left.
3051	They are not the two-legged creatures that are supposed to rule here.
3052	Hm, it looks like someone has got caught up in my spider web.
3053	I am a peaceful person. I just don't like being irritated.
3054	Is that all that you can come up with?
3055	Nobody can measure up to me!
3056	Why are people so wet on the inside? That makes my sword go rusty!
3057	Has the poison in your sting dried up yet?
3058	So how about that fighting now?
3059	Already exhausted by the heat?
3060	I like leaving people behind in the desert.
3061	Poor you, buried in the desert like this without any kind of ceremony...
3062	I'm going to tell you a secret - I hate dirt!
3063	It's quite hot, isn't it?
3064	This place is dangerous.
3065	
3066	I'm going to hit you right between the eyes.
3067	It seems like there's something around here for me to mow down.
3068	Ah yes, I can see my next prey.
3069	I like that, I like that a lot!
3070	That one there is nice and fat. That's mine!
3071	
3072	I love the smell of blood.
3073	Not much to kill recently.
3074	Hey, these are really fat!
3075	The leader will love that...
3076	
3077	Let's put on our dancing shoes!
3078	This arrow is just for you.
3079	If I get one, I'll...
3080	Hey, what's wrong?
3081	Do you think I am easily defeated?
3082	Too bad you had to run into me in the desert!
3083	Ah, this feeling; I will enjoy it forever!
3084	Thanks!
3085	I smell humans. What a delicious smell!
3086	That's right, come here...
3087	
3088	I'm so lucky that you got lost and found your way here!
3089	Stop!
3090	Bit by bit I'm going to rip it out of your flesh...
3091	Come closer so that I can scorch your skin.
3092	Do you know what kind of pain such a large amount of heat can cause?
3093	Perhaps I should cool down my flames with some fresh blood.
3094	Your blood... let me taste it.
3095	There's no point in putting up a fight.
3096	Become like me! Only flames and heat.
3097	As long as I'm here, no one will get through here!
3098	For some reason, you're starting to annoy me.
3099	
3100	Do you know where you are?
3101	
3102	You are quite a pathetic opponent for me!
3103	A sword is only useful in the hands of a warrior.
3104	Keep the sword in your hand.
3105	War is coming.
3106	And now we fight until the death!
3107	You cannot resist death any more!
3108	You will die slowly.
3109	Lava is the elixir of life.
3110	Lava keeps me alive and will be your death!
3111	Isn't it wonderful, this world of glowing lava?
3112	You dare to disturb me?
3113	You should leave if you value your life.
3114	You might regret my presence here.
3115	It's a nice day. All I want to do is have some peace and quiet.
3116	Nothing compares to the country of Doyyumhwan.
3117	A bit of fresh blood would be a nice change.
3118	You seem to be seeking your death, otherwise you wouldn't be disturbing me now. 
3119	Are you already regretting that you turned up?
3120	It's too late to run away. Face your fate.
3121	These tense times are making me nervous.
3122	Two days ago a young girl was mauled by wild animals in the area.
3123	The wild animals are getting more and more aggressive. We should try and kill as many as possible.
3124	I'm not in a good mood today. Strangers should best keep out of my way.
3125	The last warrior who I killed, begged for his life.
3126	Someone has to do something about these stones.
3127	I don't trust the peacefulness of the morning.
3128	The tension in the air is making me uncomfortable.
3129	These arrowheads have been forged very well.
3130	If I were you I'd be careful. That arrow is aiming straight for your heart.
3131	I should go there and kill one of those beasts.
3132	A good martial arts training is essential in these times.
3133	The soldiers cannot control the chaos in the country any more.
3134	Why are you looking at me like that?
3135	Cowards have a small chance of surviving.
3136	Don't overestimate yourself.
3137	Someone seems to have trained you very well.
3138	Even my ancestors managed to assert themselves in battle in these territories.
3139	You have to be alert and skilled out here.
3140	Don't even think about wasting my time.
3141	So, how does it feel to know that your life is in danger?
3142	Do you want to give up already?
3143	Get prepared to suffer.
3144	Oh man! That sword looks fantastic.
3145	Be more persistent and increase your power!
3146	Do you think you can become as strong as I am?
3147	Okay. Let's get serious.
3148	Oh my! I'm just a weak woman!
3149	You look tired. Why don't you give up already? Hehe.
3150	What is Serangyi going to do today, hm?
3151	I am so bored. Play with me!
3152	I have to say I like the Sura guy most.
3153	Hey! How about a fight?
3154	Don't underestimate me just because I'm a woman!
3155	Pain only lasts a moment...
3156	I want to get out of here, at all costs.
3157	How safe are the homes of the individual members?
3158	Shut up, girls!
3159	Let me defeat you. With a single blow.
3160	Don't even think about running away!
3161	So, why don't we get started?
3162	Don't forget: All men are enemies.
3163	If a person has a pretty face, we can make an exception...
3164	What, you want to fight?
3165	It won't take long, but it will hurt.
3166	Oh, you really seem to be in pain...?
3167	Goodbye! Now go to hell!
3168	So, what do you do in the White Oath?
3169	Where are you going?
3170	Hey, you want to fight?
3171	Hehe! You're dodging my hits...?
3172	Do you think you can run away from me?
3173	Here comes my hit!
3174	God, I am so tired!
3175	Hey, nice armour! Did it cost a lot?
3176	But at least we have nice weather.
3177	Oh, you trained a lot! Great!
3178	What do you think about my skills? Good, huh? Ha ha!
3179	What's up? Oh, you're irritated by my incredible speediness!
3180	Why don't I go hunting?
3181	Nobody has attacked our village today.
3182	If you want to fight, then fight, you bastard!
3183	Hehe, you are just a beginner!
3184	What should I shoot first, in your arm or in your leg?
3185	Here comes my arrow!
3186	I have to go to the village and train.
3187	I feel so stiff.
3188	What's for dinner today?
3189	I'm watching, so scream as much as you want.
3190	Waited too long? How about swinging that sword of yours!
3191	This sword has such a great sound!
3192	This sword is ready!
3193	Hmm, let's see: Who should this sword kill first...
3194	Hey, what are you staring at?
3195	First, your belly!
3196	I'd like to use you as a sheath.
3197	I'd like to use you as a sheath.
3198	I'm starving.
3199	Is there anything to eat?
3200	Why am I still hungry after all this food?
3201	Aaargh, die!
3202	My stomach will decide this fight!
3203	It's the choice between heaven and hell!
3204	I can't stand it anymore! My body is itching everywhere!
3205	Oh yeah. I can see a few pigs!
3206	On the ground already?
3207	I'll finish you with one hit.
3208	That's going to be a great memory!
3209	Die!
3210	My body has softened.
3211	Why don't I train more?
3212	Afraid, huh?
3213	Ah, another victim of my powerful weapon.
3214	Can you see my attack pattern? No? Your loss!
3215	Even small cuts can influence your health. Especially if they have come from a mace!
3216	Damn, these hands are really impractical.
3217	What are you staring at? Never seen someone with an iron fist?
3218	You people really annoy me.
3219	Do you want me to beat you up? If you don't then run away. Got it?
3220	Now watch, I'm going to show you my big hit!
3221	Stop staring at my hand!
3222	Hey you over there! Do you want to fight? Then come here!
3223	I think I'm pretty breath-taking...
3224	Why don't we plan something?
3225	No, you are not allowed to leave yet. Fight!
3226	Ha, there you have it!
3227	You're dead meat!
3228	Hey, stay here! Play with me!
3229	I could carve something nice out of your bones...
3230	We haven't trained yet today.
3231	Wow, that's great armour! I want to have it.
3232	From now on, you will find it hard to ignore my attacks!
3233	Ha, ha, ha! Bet you didn't expect that!
3234	Beauty isn't everything.
3235	Don't stare, fight!
3236	I don't like the way that you are staring at me. Come here!
3237	It's an honour to die at my sword!
3238	
3239	Great!
3240	Hey there, don't touch!
3241	Seems like my bowstrings have been cut.
3242	Damn, those idiots were here.
3243	Not bad. But you are going to die anyway.
3244	You're okay with this? That's great!
3245	Here comes the arrow!
3246	Come here everyone!
3247	La, lala, I'm whistling a song...
3248	What fantastic weather!
3249	
3250	Great! I appreciate your fighting spirit!
3251	Come here! Everybody to me!
3252	I'm starving!
3253	I have a craving for some fruit.
3254	Well, OK fish will do. Attack!
3255	Hey, don't run away! Stop!
3256	I won. It's obvious!
3257	You see? You missed it, haha!
3258	You should watch out, haha!
3259	Where am I?
3260	Nice weather today.
3261	You came to hunt me down? That's ridiculous!
3262	You are my next victim.
3263	Quite painful isn't it? Well, I'll make it quick.
3264	Look at how strong I am: I can swing this huge club!
3265	Boring!
3266	My whole body is itching.
3267	Let's see who's faster.
3268	You started it. So don't make me responsible for your death!
3269	Once you're in, you won't get out any more. There's no escape!
3270	Here comes the last hit. I'll finish you!
3271	I've made a yummy new poison. Would you like a taste?
3272	I want to see how it works! Here, take it!
3273	Hey you there! Come here, do you want to be my test person?
3274	I'll poison you!
3275	Ah, very good! A guinea pig!
3276	It isn't any fun if you give up that quickly! Come on, defend yourself!
3277	Wait a moment. I'm looking for something to hunt.
3278	It's no use if you move that slowly. Move!
3279	Man, I am so hungry!
3280	It's great that I've found something to hunt!
3281	Let all hope of survival go! You won't survive me!
3282	Now you'll find out what real pain feels like!
3283	Boooring!
3284	I wonder if there's anything we can use as bait?
3285	Come and fight if you want to!
3286	You want to be a warrior? Then show me what you've got!
3287	
3288	Escape to the village if you want to live!
3289	Starving is a pitiful death.
3290	Oh, they're coming straight towards us!
3291	How about a duel?
3292	Don't compare me to those bastards!
3293	Here comes my thunder-strike! Ha!
3294	Those who run away now are not a real warriors!
3295	This time, the poison should work better!
3296	When you're hungry, bats are a real delicacy!
3297	How about a fight?
3298	Once my poison enters your body, there's no cure any more.
3299	My magic will burn everything down, hehehe!
3300	Burn! Ha, ha!
3301	Never forget to sharpen your sword! The next fight is sooner than you think.
3302	Feeling faint?
3303	Die, and wake up in the afterlife!
3304	Defeat me? Are you sure?
3305	Fight like a man!
3306	Come on, just a little bit more.
3307	Ha, I'm looking forward to a nice fight.
3308	Fighting is fun, haha!
3309	Fight! More and more! Yeah!
3310	Ha, very good! Try it again!
3311	Look at my sword spinning!
3312	You'll regret hitting me!
3313	So weak! How ridiculous!
3314	I don't want to be disturbed.
3315	Go to sleep. Forever!
3316	Do you still not want to sleep?
3317	There's so much to do! Let's get on with it!
3318	Don't let yourself be intimidated by my power, haha!
3319	I'll pulverise you!
3320	Great, strong opponents last longer! Defend yourself!
3321	What? Do you have a problem with my brother?
3322	Don't compare me to that beginner!
3323	He doesn't like you and I don't like you either!
3324	Let's fight.
3325	Until death!
3326	Look, a butterfly! How pretty!
3327	Don't you see the truth of heaven and earth?
3328	Later will be too late. You have to believe it now!
3329	Believe the doctrine of the esoterics!
3330	Those who doubt must die!
3331	Get enlightenment by embracing death!
3332	The truth of the esoteric belief is understanding the order of heaven.
3333	The philosophy of the esoteric belief is the heavenly order!
3334	Esoteric truth; truth of the Tiger God; Sabaha Sabaha.
3335	You dare to doubt the truth of heaven and earth?
3336	
3337	Feel my claws!
3338	When the truth of the Tiger God is sung for eternity, all suffering will end.
3339	The truth about the esoteric belief lies in understanding the order of heaven.
3340	Sabaha Sabaha. Send us knowledge!
3341	Don't doubt it!
3342	Receive the thunder of heaven!
3343	Judgement's blow!
3344	The truth about the esoteric belief lies in understanding the order of heaven.
3345	Esoteric truth; truth of the Tiger God; Sabaha Sabaha.
3346	You think I'm a clown don't you? You won't for long!
3347	The leader of our sect is a saint and is above all living beings!
3348	Burn in the flames of hell!
3349	Bet you've never seen such a large tuning fork before, eh?
3350	Esoteric truth; truth of the Tiger God; Sabaha Sabaha.
3351	The truth about the esoteric belief lies in understanding the order of heaven.
3352	Just because I'm smaller than my brother, it doesn't mean that I'm going to put up with everything!
3353	Eternal pain and darkness await you!
3354	
3355	This isn't the end. On the contrary: It can only get better.
3356	All we ask for is peace and privacy! Please!
3357	If fear overcomes you, put your trust in the Tiger God.
3358	The truth of the esoteric faith lies in the order and understanding of heaven.
3359	Let's all go to hell!
3360	I won't let you go!
3361	I'll give you everything I have.
3362	I beg you, please save us!
3363	The truth about the esoteric belief lies in understanding the order of heaven.
3364	Esoteric truth; truth of the Tiger God; Sabaha Sabaha.
3365	The gates to hell are wide open. Get in!
3366	I'm warning you: Don't force me to use the board!
3367	I have seen that you are going to die!
3368	Let me think: How can I summarise the order of heaven and earth in just a few words?
3369	I can hear the chants of the believers.
3370	That's right! Be full of remorse, and you will be rescued!
3371	You will suffer eternal pain, because you continue to question the lore.
3372	Let me teach you.
3373	Don't regard it as pain - see it as a lesson.
3374	I might not be pretty, but I have a lot of fun, hihihi!
3375	You have to become like us!
3376	Come over to us, hihi!
3377	Haaa, haha!
3378	Here we go!
3379	This is hell!
3380	Ahhhhh!
3381	We can't do this alone! No!
3382	You have to taste the pain, too!
3383	How about an exchange? You give me your soul and I'll give you my suffering!
3384	You'll find eternal peace soon!
3385	Oh, the pain! The pain!
3386	Aargghh, damn! My arm's burning!
3387	Why do we have to suffer like this? What have we done to deserve this?
3388	Suffering from this mysterious disease isn't that bad!

3411	I can't take you there, as I have never been[ENTER]there myself.
3412	Transport
3413	Hello! I know how you can get to other regions[ENTER]from here. If you give me some Yang, I can[ENTER]teleport you there.
3414	It costs 
3415	Yang.
3416	Don't transport
3417	Where do you want to go to?
3418	No
3477	You don't have enough Yang!

3478	Thanks. Maybe later.
3479	All right.
3419	Old Pirate:[ENTER]If you have time for chit-chat, you have time to[ENTER]go to the doctor!

3422	Tell the Old Pirate that you couldn't get hold of[ENTER]the medicine.

3426	Take the medicine to the old pirate.
3427	Take the medicine to the Old Pirate and claim[ENTER]your reward.
3428	I have got the medicine.

3430	Baek-Go:[ENTER]You haven't found anything yet?[ENTER]We must stop the disease before it spreads across[ENTER]the whole village! Hurry!
3431	Return to Baek-Go
3432	Go back to Baek-Go.
3433	Tell Baek-Go you couldn't find the pathogen of[ENTER]the mysterious disease.
3434	Go back to Baek-Go.
3435	I can't find the pathogen of the mysterious[ENTER]disease! What should I tell Baek-Go?
3436	Take the sample to Baek-Go
3437	Take a sample of the pathogen of the mysterious[ENTER]disease to Baek-Go.
3438	Give him the sample of the pathogen of the[ENTER]mysterious disease and get the medicine for the[ENTER]old pirate.
3439	I have a sample of the pathogen of the mysterious[ENTER]disease.
3440	I have a sample of the virus of the mysterious[ENTER]illness. I should take it to Baek-Go.
3441	I don't know what's behind this mysterious[ENTER]disease.
3442	I found the cause of the mysterious disease.
3443	Kill all infected persons
3444	Kill everyone who has been infected with the[ENTER]mysterious disease!
3445	Kill everyone who has been infected with the[ENTER]mysterious disease, and take a sample of the[ENTER]pathogen to Baek-Go. He's going to make medicine[ENTER]for the old pirate.
3446	Baek-Go:[ENTER]Someone else already delivered a sample of the[ENTER]pathogen. I sent the medicine to the old pirate;[ENTER]he should be okay now.
3447	Baek-Go:[ENTER]He had contact with an infected person only once,[ENTER]and his wound started to itch and suppurate?
3448	Baek-Go:[ENTER]Oh my! I'm quite sure he is infected with this[ENTER]mysterious disease! If he isn't treated, the[ENTER]disease will spread across the whole village!
3449	Baek-Go:[ENTER]He mustn't infect anybody! You have to treat him[ENTER]immediately. For that we need a sample of the[ENTER]virus of the mysterious illness. You can get this[ENTER]sample from a sick person. There are lots of them[ENTER]on Mount Sohan in the North.
3450	Baek-Go:[ENTER]You did it! Wait a moment, I'll make the medicine[ENTER]right now. [DELAY value;1000] [/DELAY][ENTER][ENTER]I was in a hurry, so I don't know whether it'll[ENTER]really work, but he should at least feel better.[ENTER]Take the medicine to him as fast as possible.
3451	The Old Pirate sends me.
3452	The Old Pirate's illness
3453	Old Pirate:[ENTER]It still itches. But I feel better now. Guess I[ENTER]can live with that.
3454	I don't have the medicine yet.
3455	Here's the cure!
3456	Salesperson:[ENTER]The old pirate? Of course I know him! You're[ENTER]talking about this bloke who constantly curses[ENTER]and scratches himself, aren't you? He comes by[ENTER]often to buy some liquid remedy. He spent several[ENTER]thousand Yang on the red medicine.
3457	General Store Saleswoman:[ENTER]Where on earth does he get so many Yang if he[ENTER]isn't even working? I have already told him a[ENTER]number of times he should let a doctor examine[ENTER]him but he doesn't listen to me.[ENTER]The red cure only relieves the symptoms but[ENTER]doesn't cure the illness. I'm afraid it is not[ENTER]going to end well with him.
3458	Do you know the Old Pirate?
3459	Of course I'll help you.
3460	Old Pirate:[ENTER]Great! Good luck![ENTER]The doctor is most probably in the city.

3463	Go to Baek-Go in the city and ask him for[ENTER]medicine for the Old Pirate.
3464	Sorry, I can't.
3465	Old Pirate:[ENTER]Well, then I don't have anything left to say to[ENTER]you!
3466	Old pirate:[ENTER]Damnit, what do you want from me? Crap! The hag[ENTER]from the general store told you about me, didn't[ENTER]she?[ENTER]Yes, everything she said is true. But I don't[ENTER]have time to go see the doctor. I have so many[ENTER]enemies!
3467	Old pirate:[ENTER]You never know if one of those scoundrels won't[ENTER]just suddenly show up in front of you and stab[ENTER]you in the back! But the itching is so terrible;[ENTER]I can't take it any more! How about it? Could you[ENTER]go to the doctor and get the medicine? If you get[ENTER]it, I'll give you a great reward.
3468	Old Pirate:[ENTER]Someone else has already got me the medicine.[ENTER]Well, I'm afraid that means no reward for you!
3469	Go to the Old Pirate
3470	Go to the old pirate.
3471	Go to the Old Pirate and ask him why he doesn't[ENTER]want to see a doctor.
3472	Old Pirate:[ENTER]Everything itches! I shouldn't have bumped into[ENTER]that guy! We barely touched! Ever since, the spot[ENTER]he touched has been ulcerating, and my whole body[ENTER]itches! It's as if I were rotting while still[ENTER]alive! Bastard!
3473	Old Pirate:[ENTER]What? I have been infected with the mysterious[ENTER]illness?! And that is the necessary medicine?[ENTER]Thank you very, very much! You have probably[ENTER]saved my life. I appreciate it.

4508	You're back![ENTER]Did you get anything from the En-Tai Warriors?
4509	I've looked into everything, but didn't find[ENTER]anything of importance.
4510	Very strange. I was pretty certain my hunch was[ENTER]correct...[ENTER]Very well. I'll go over it in my mind once more[ENTER]and then call on you. Please wait until then.
4511	All right.
4512	The Guardian of the Forest has been looking[ENTER]everywhere for you. Go and find him and listen to[ENTER]what he has to say.
4513	I'm back! I hope you didn't run into any[ENTER]difficulties while I was away?[ENTER]Well, I've examined everything that was written[ENTER]in the Spirit of the Earth. The Enchanted Forest[ENTER]of Dawn is not what it used to be, and the[ENTER]changes are far more alarming than I first[ENTER]realised.[ENTER]If we don't act soon, this place will be[ENTER]destroyed!
4514	I'd like you to help in the investigation.[ENTER]Please... will you join us?
4515	Yes, of course.
4516	Excellent![ENTER]Here's the situation. I have an Aid Kit here for[ENTER]my brothers. They're out exploring the region and[ENTER]have run into some trouble. In fact, some of them[ENTER]have recently gone missing. I've searched high[ENTER]and low for them, but they've disappeared without[ENTER]a trace.[ENTER]I can only assume they've been taken by a band of[ENTER]En-Tai Warriors. I've seen a number of them[ENTER]roaming around this area, acting very...[ENTER]strangely. Please, find out if they're[ENTER]responsible for the disappearance.
4517	You look very familiar... have we met somewhere[ENTER]before?[ENTER]Whatever. As you've no doubt heard, the Enchanted[ENTER]Forest is changing rapidly. We can't combat these[ENTER]new developments on our own.[ENTER]Would you help us? It would be fantastic if you[ENTER]could lend us your support!
4518	Kill En-Tai Warriors.
4519	Kill the En-Tai Warriors in the Enchanted Forest[ENTER]and return to the Guardian of the Forest.
4521	Find and talk to the Guardian of the Forest.
4520	Find the Aid Kit
4522	Let's see now.[ENTER]Yes, this is it! Now I can send the Aid Kit to my[ENTER]brothers.[ENTER]I owe you my deepest thanks. I'll never forget[ENTER]what great service you've done for me.
4523	We've been out here for quite some time already,[ENTER]and the supplies are gradually coming to an end.[ENTER]I'd better send this immediately.[ENTER]Let's see if anything else is missing. I'll call[ENTER]on you afterwards. In the meantime, take a load[ENTER]off your feet!
4524	The Guardian of the Forest has been looking for[ENTER]you. Go to him, he wants to talk to you.
4525	Welcome back, brave warrior![ENTER]I was clearly barking up the wrong tree![ENTER]Now I'm sure of it. This strange creature is[ENTER]responsible for everything. I assume it has used[ENTER]some kind of magic. As soon as it left, the Aid[ENTER]Kit disappeared as well.[ENTER]This magician, this warlock, this shaman or[ENTER]whatever the devil it is, he must be around here[ENTER]somewhere. Please, find him!
4526	Very well, I'll find him.
4527	Excellent. I'll wait for you here![ENTER]Just be careful.
4528	Find the Aid Kit
4529	Kill the En-Tai Druid and retrieve the Aid Kit.
4530	You've got the Aid Kit from the En-Tai Druid.[ENTER]Take it to the Guardian of the Forest.
4531	Do you need more time?[ENTER]They must be around here somewhere. I'm certain[ENTER]they're using some kind of powerful magic.[ENTER]Please, find them and bring me the Aid Kit.
4533	Oh! I do apologise. Please forgive my behaviour.[ENTER]Thanks for coming all this way and delivering[ENTER]this Aid Kit. These medicines are urgently[ENTER]needed![ENTER]Before we do anything else, let me put this kit[ENTER]in a safe place. Just wait here for me a moment,[ENTER]will you?
4532	Deliver the Aid Kit
4534	Sure, I'll wait.
4535	The Guardian of the Forest has been looking for[ENTER]you. Find him and listen to what he has to say.
4536	Did you get chance to rest? Good.[ENTER]I've checked over the Aid Kit, there's nothing[ENTER]missing. Now it's high time we delivered the kit[ENTER]to my brothers. Please ensure you don't lose[ENTER]anything on the way!
4537	Of course.
4538	Very good. Be on your guard!
4539	Deliver the Aid Kit to the Scout of the Forest.
4540	What are you still doing here?[ENTER]There are important medicines in that Aid Kit![ENTER]Please, get a move on! It's required urgently!
4541	Who's there?![ENTER]What do you think you're doing here?
4542	The Guardian of the Forest sent me.[ENTER]He wanted me to give you this.
4544	You've destroyed all the Metins of the Tree[ENTER]Beings. Report back to the Scout of the Forest.
4543	Secondary Investigations
4545	What are you waiting for?[ENTER]If you don't set out immediately, there'll only[ENTER]be ever more Metin stones! Quickly, destroy the[ENTER]Metins of the Tree Beings or we're all doomed!
4546	Find and talk to the Scout of the Forest.
4547	You did it! Fantastic! While you were destroying[ENTER]the Metins of the Tree Beings, I've managed to[ENTER]obtain some spores from the mushrooms.[ENTER]We'll have to see what use they are. But first we[ENTER]have another job to deal with.
4548	The Scout of the Forest has been looking for you.[ENTER]Go and talk to him.
4549	I've sorry I made you wait for so long. How did[ENTER]you manage to find your way over here anyway?
4550	The Temple Guardian asked me to help out in[ENTER]investigating the Enchanted Forest. Can you tell[ENTER]me what needs doing?
4551	I admire your bravery.
4552	Many of the trees in this forest have turned to[ENTER]stone.[ENTER]These stones radiate a powerful and mystical[ENTER]energy which makes a tremendous noise. Please[ENTER]help me to destroy these stones.
4553	I will.
4554	Destroy the Stones
4555	Destroy the Metins of the Tree Beings and return[ENTER]to the Scout of the Forest.
4557	Find and talk to the Scout of the Forest.
4556	En-Tai Dew
4558	Did you find the En-Tai Destroyers and get the[ENTER]En-Tai Dew? So I was right![ENTER]Thanks to your help we now have the En-Tai Dew.[ENTER]I'll be able to use that to stop the noise. Here,[ENTER]take this. It's not much, just a token of[ENTER]appreciation for your services.[ENTER]Now look for the Outrider of the Forest.
4559	The Scout of the Forest has been looking for you.[ENTER]Go and listen to what he has to say.
4560	Hmm... I wonder if this really is the legendary[ENTER]En-Tai Dew I've heard about?[ENTER]Legend has it that the people use this dew to[ENTER]drive out demons.[ENTER]Presumably it would be best if we obtained this[ENTER]chimeric liquid from the En-Tai Destroyers[ENTER]themselves.
4561	Could you get this dew for me? I'm sure you'll[ENTER]manage!
4562	Absolutely!
4563	Obtain En-Tai Dew
4564	Kill the En-Tai Destroyers and obtain 5 lots of[ENTER]En-Tai Dew.
4565	You've obtained the En-Tai Dew from the En-Tai[ENTER]Destroyers. Deliver it to the Scout of the[ENTER]Forest.
4566	Did you manage to get the En-Tai Dew? Not yet?[ENTER]We're running out of time!
4568	Find and talk to the Outrider of the Forest.
4567	Kill the En-Tai Sovereign
4569	Unbelievable! You actually managed it![ENTER]First of all I should busy myself with[ENTER]investigating the %s. Will you wait until I'm[ENTER]finished?
4570	The Outrider of the Forest is looking for you. Go[ENTER]and find him and listen to the job he has for[ENTER]you.
4571	You must be the brave warrior the Scout of the[ENTER]Forest told me about. Ever since he mentioned[ENTER]your feats I've been waiting for you to appear![ENTER]Well now, listen to me very carefully.
4572	My duty is to patrol the forest. Lately I've[ENTER]observed how the En-Tai have become increasingly[ENTER]dangerous. They are a threat to each and every[ENTER]one of us. You need to kill their ruler!
4573	I would kill him myself, but after so many[ENTER]battles my sword is no longer sharp enough. Find[ENTER]the En-Tai Sovereign and bring me the Fine Timber[ENTER]from him.
4574	Affirmative.
4575	Kill the En-Tai Sovereign and collect some Fine[ENTER]Timber.
4576	You have received Fine Timber from the En-Tai[ENTER]Sovereign. Return to the Outrider of the Forest[ENTER]and report.
4577	What do you mean, you haven't found him? I even[ENTER]marked his location for you on the map!
4579	Talk to the Outrider of the Forest.
4578	Obtain a Tree Emerald
4580	You did it! How fortunate I am to be able to see[ENTER]this with my own eyes![ENTER]Well, time for me to try to tempt out a dryad and[ENTER]capture it in the Tree Emerald.
4581	We did it! Brave warrior, take this. It's the[ENTER]Stone of the Dryads.[ENTER]The En-Tai Sovereigns protect the true King of[ENTER]the En-Tai with powerful spells.[ENTER]You'll only be able to confront Jotun Thrym if[ENTER]you're carrying this stone with you.[ENTER]Quickly now, find the leader of the Forest[ENTER]Guardians!
4582	The Outrider of the Forest is looking for you.[ENTER]Find him and listen to what task he has lined up[ENTER]for you.
4583	You're back! I've been studying the En-Tai[ENTER]Sovereigns for some time, and was pretty sure it[ENTER]was Fine Timber that we needed. But I've taken a[ENTER]closer look at it and... well, unfortunately it[ENTER]isn't the stuff we need.[ENTER]Please return to the En-Tai Sovereigns once more.
4584	Is that really necessary?
4585	We need to find out where the king of the En-Tai[ENTER]Sovereigns is hiding. But they certainly won't[ENTER]reveal that information to us so easily.
4586	Okay, I'll do it.
4587	Kill the En-Tai Sovereign and obtain a Tree[ENTER]Emerald.
4588	You received a Tree Emerald from the En-Tai[ENTER]Sovereign. Deliver it to the Outrider of the[ENTER]Forest.
4589	You can't be back already![ENTER]Come on, get the Tree Emerald.[ENTER]And hurry up about it!
12091	A New Continent
12092	You have found the new continent Yohara.[ENTER]Go to the statue.
12093	Do you want to travel to the new continent Yohara?
12094	Yes
12095	No
12096	Be careful.
12097	You're not ready yet.[ENTER]Level restriction: %d[ENTER]Only characters level %d or higher may enter.
12098	Risking Your Neck
12099	A guard needs you urgently.[ENTER]Make your way to the point marked on the map.
12100	What's up?
12101	Hey, it's very dangerous here![ENTER]If you're one of the villagers, you should[ENTER]retreat to a safer place.
12102	Stop, wait a moment. Aren't you a mighty hero?[ENTER]Can you help us?
12103	An evil horde is menacing us.[ENTER]The village has already been attacked and many[ENTER]people have lost their lives.[ENTER]We need to stay here and protect the village.
12104	Please go to the guard at the border to the new[ENTER]continent.
12105	Please find the Yohara Guard. His location is[ENTER]marked on the map.
12106	With the Devil on Your Back
12107	Find the guard fighting the Devils at the border[ENTER]to the new continent.
12108	Oh... This place is a battlefield.[ENTER]Are you the hero?[ENTER]Please help us to fight the Devils so they don't[ENTER]reach our village.
12109	Kill 300 monsters in the surrounding area.
12110	Monsters remaining
12111	Kill %d monsters in the surrounding area.
12112	Monsters remaining: %d
12113	There are too many demons here. I don't know if[ENTER]we can do this...
12114	I've killed all %d monsters.[ENTER]I should return to the Yohara Guard.
12115	I've killed all the monsters![ENTER]I should return to the Yohara Guard.
12116	Thanks to you, we can catch our breath for a[ENTER]moment.[ENTER]Where are you from?[ENTER]When you were fighting those demons, I realised[ENTER]immediately that you were special.
12117	How can I show my gratitude for your help...?[ENTER]Here. I tried to study this book some time ago.[ENTER]This precision will be important so you should[ENTER]read it carefully.
12118	Your inventory is full.
12119	The Yohara Guard is looking for you again. You'd[ENTER]better see what he wants.
12120	Go back to the Yohara Guard.
12121	Devils' Leader
12122	I should ask the Yohara Guard about the Devils'[ENTER]leader.[ENTER]My destination is marked on the map.
12123	You helped our soldiers greatly by killing those[ENTER]demons. But those creatures just won't stop[ENTER]attacking our village!
12124	I think you should venture into our enemies'[ENTER]territory and kill the Devils' leader.
12125	Go and kill him.
12126	No.
12127	Very good! Go and talk to Admiral Angmur. He[ENTER]arrived here before you.[ENTER]I've heard he's having big problems with the[ENTER]demons too.
12128	Talk to Admiral Angmur, whose position is shown[ENTER]on the map.
12129	You must be afraid... I'm afraid of the demons[ENTER]too.
12130	Talk to Admiral Angmur, whose position is shown[ENTER]on the map.
12131	Please hurry and talk to Admiral Angmur.[ENTER]He's in the middle of the fighting there.
12132	I knew it was you who was fighting the demons.[ENTER]What I didn't know was that the demons would[ENTER]suddenly swarm out this far.
12133	I have no idea what I would do without you.[ENTER]This region was created by Sung Mahi.[ENTER]I'll tell you the story later; first, we should[ENTER]fight them together.
12134	I'll tell you what you need to do.[ENTER]As you know, the Devils are following their[ENTER]leader's orders.[ENTER]Your mission now is to kill the Devils' leader[ENTER]King Bao.
12135	Head to the position shown on the map and destroy[ENTER]King Bao.
12136	I've received a mission from Admiral Angmur.[ENTER]I need to head to the point marked on the map and[ENTER]kill King Bao.
12137	As you can see, we don't have much time left.[ENTER]You need to kill King Bao as quickly as possible!
12138	I've killed the Devils' leader King Bao.[ENTER]Now I should speak to Admiral Angmur!
12139	Really?[ENTER]You killed the demon?
12140	Then we can breathe easily for a moment.[ENTER]I'll come and find you if we ever need your help[ENTER]again.
12141	You should learn that quickly.
12142	A Strange Feeling
12143	Go to Admiral Angmur.
12144	Do you get the feeling that something strange is[ENTER]happening and that you can't move the way you[ENTER]want to?[ENTER]It's the same for me. It's because of Sung Mahi's[ENTER]power acting on your body.
12145	To protect yourself against the effects of this[ENTER]evil, you'll need to find gear with a Sung Ma[ENTER]bonus.[ENTER]However, as this is pretty difficult to get hold[ENTER]of right now and because you helped us, I'm going[ENTER]to help you this time.
12146	You permanently receive +%d Sung Ma's will (RES)!
12147	A Strange Feeling
12148	I destroyed the Devils' leader just as Admiral[ENTER]Angmur asked of me.[ENTER]But nothing has changed.[ENTER]I need to return to Admiral Angmur.
12149	The Devils' leader was killed, but the demons are[ENTER]still getting more aggressive.[ENTER]The don't seem to care about what happened to[ENTER]their leader.[ENTER]These endless hordes of monsters are wearing me[ENTER]down.[ENTER]Would you take care of them for me?
12150	Kill the demons.
12152	Yes
12153	No
12154	You never tire. Please destroy %d demons in the[ENTER]nearby area.
12155	Although the Devils' leader was destroyed, the[ENTER]Devils are getting more and more aggressive. Kill[ENTER]%d monsters.
12156	Are you getting tired too? Go and get some rest[ENTER]and then come back...
12157	I've received a mission from Admiral Angmur.[ENTER]I should kill those %d pesky monsters.
12158	You want me to help you kill them?[ENTER]No.[ENTER]I need to rest more first.
12159	I've killed %d monsters.[ENTER]I should return to Admiral Angmur.
12160	I've killed all the monsters![ENTER]Now head back to Admiral Angmur quickly.
12162	Thanks to you I'm well-rested now! Thank you very[ENTER]much.
12163	Preparations for the Disruption Ritual
12164	I've received a letter from Confucius.[ENTER]Hopefully, Admiral Angmur knows how we should[ENTER]proceed against the aggressive monsters.
12165	I've received a letter from Confucius.[ENTER]It says that the demons are under Sung Mahi's[ENTER]thrall and only listen to his orders. They no[ENTER]longer recognise their true leader.
12166	To banish Sung Mahi's influence at least for a[ENTER]short while, we should lay Tainted Flowers on the[ENTER]demons' shrine.[ENTER]So we need to find the shrine and some of these[ENTER]flowers.[ENTER]Would you do that for me?
12167	Yes
12168	No
12169	You really are incredible! First, find the[ENTER]shrine, then gather some Tainted Flowers and[ENTER]return to me.
12170	The shrine is marked on the map.
12171	If you are exhausted, come back here and rest.
12172	I should find the demon's shrine.[ENTER]The shrine is marked on the map.
12173	You have discovered the shrine.[ENTER]Return to Admiral Angmur.
12174	I can't believe you found the shrine so quickly.[ENTER]But you just stay here and get some rest.
12175	You have discovered the shrine.[ENTER]Return to Admiral Angmur.
12176	You have already discovered the shrine?[ENTER]Impressive![ENTER]Now we need some Tainted Flowers to lay on it.[ENTER]The monsters nearby might be carrying some. Get[ENTER]me %d Tainted Flowers.
12177	I've found the shrine, and now I need %d Tainted[ENTER]Flowers.
12178	Tainted Flowers remaining
12179	I need more Tainted Flowers.[ENTER]The monsters here are bound to be carrying some.
12180	Tainted Flowers remaining: %d
12181	I've gathered all %d Tainted Flowers.[ENTER]Now head back to Admiral Angmur quickly!
12182	These Tainted Flowers aren't enough. Please get[ENTER]some more of them.
12183	I've gathered all %d Tainted Flowers.[ENTER]Now head back to Admiral Angmur quickly!
12184	You are really fast.[ENTER]We now have all the flowers we need and know[ENTER]where the shrine is located.[ENTER]Let's perform the ritual!
12185	Disruption Ritual
12186	I still need to perform the ritual for Admiral[ENTER]Angmur.[ENTER]I should talk to him.
12187	It is time to disrupt Sung Mahi's influence over[ENTER]the demons.[ENTER]You will need the Tainted Flowers for that.[ENTER]Go to the shrine when you are ready.
12188	Go to the shrine to break Sung Mahi's spell.
12189	Lay the Tainted Flowers on the shrine.[ENTER]The shrine is marked on the map.
12190	Have you already been to the shrine?
12191	Lay the Tainted Flowers on the shrine.
12192	The flowers glow brightly and then wither.
12193	I have disrupted Sung Mahi's spell.[ENTER]I should return to Admiral Angmur.
12194	You have completed your task.[ENTER]Return to Admiral Angmur.
12195	I saw a light in the distance. Was that your[ENTER]ritual?[ENTER]That's good. But Confucius says it won't last[ENTER]long.
12196	We have done everything we possibly could here.[ENTER]Report the news to Confucius. He's bound to need[ENTER]more help for the village.
12197	You have received a reward.
4590	Black Matter
4591	Yak-Hwan is looking for you. Please go to him.
4592	Welcome. Yon-I-Walker has ended his[ENTER]investigations. The phenomenon that you observed[ENTER]in Fireland has been identified as Black Matter.
4593	It flows out of the interior of the fortress and[ENTER]alters the demons in the surroundings. The longer[ENTER]the amount of time they are under its influence,[ENTER]the stronger and more aggressive they become. We[ENTER]need to stop this Black Matter from spreading[ENTER]further!
4594	
4595	Whilst our alchemist searches for a solution, we[ENTER]shouldn't sit around on our thumbs here. Return[ENTER]to the Fireland and defeat 300 demons in the[ENTER]fortress' surroundings.
4596	Got it.
4597	Thank you. Now hurry!
4598	Defeat 300 Fireland demons in the fortress[ENTER]surroundings and at the location of the Sun[ENTER]Herbs.
4599	Black Matter
4600	Defeat 300 Fireland demons in the fortress[ENTER]surroundings and at the location of the Sun[ENTER]Herbs.
4601	I fear that you have not yet defeated enough[ENTER]demons. Head back into Fireland and keep[ENTER]fighting.
4602	You have defeated all of the demons.[ENTER]Now report back to Yak-Hwan.
4603	Seek out Yak-Hwan.
4604	Very good, that should have held up the spread of[ENTER]Black Matter. Relax a little whilst I talk with[ENTER]the alchemist.
4605	Nimbus Tincture
4606	The alchemist is looking for you. It seems to be[ENTER]urgent!
4607	A catastrophe! I told Yak-Hwan to act with care.[ENTER]And what does he go and do? Charges us head first[ENTER]with swords raised into chaos! The Black Matter[ENTER]grows and spreads faster when the host that it[ENTER]has nested in dies. Now I hear that 300 infected[ENTER]demons have already been killed! That is not[ENTER]good...
4608	Under these conditions, even my Nimbus Tincture,[ENTER]which was supposed to banish the Black Matter,[ENTER]will no longer suffice. I urgently need[ENTER]ingredients to make more of it.
4609	
4610	Bring me 10 Foundation Stones, 50 Bear Galls, 10[ENTER]Spider's Poison Sacks and 200 Energy Fragments.[ENTER]An experienced warrior such as yourself certainly[ENTER]does not need telling where these things can be[ENTER]found, right?
4611	I'll be right on my way.
4612	Very good. Hurry, as with every minute that we do[ENTER]not do anything, the Black Matter is spreading[ENTER]further.
4613	Get hold of the ingredients for the Nimbus[ENTER]Tincture.
4614	Remaining
4615	Nimbus Tincture
4616	Locate 10 Foundation Stones, 50 Bear Galls, 10[ENTER]Spider's Poison Sacks and 200 Energy Fragments.[ENTER]Bring these ingredients to the alchemist.
4617	You have found all of the ingredients! Great, I[ENTER]will get to work. I will call for you as soon as[ENTER]the Nimbus Tincture is finished.
4618	If we don't stop the Black Matter soon, it looks[ENTER]does not look good for us all. Go, bring me all[ENTER]the ingredients for the Nimbus Tincture!
4619	You have all the necessary ingredients. Return to[ENTER]the alchemist.
4620	Talk to the alchemist.
4621	Stop the Black Matter
4622	Such a... hmph... I complained to the blacksmith,[ENTER]because the Foundation Stones have been ground[ENTER]too roughly. And now? He is offended and refuses[ENTER]to convert the rest of the stones into powder.[ENTER]The stubborn mule! Could you talk to him please?
4623	Certainly.
4624	Thanks. Please take this basket of treats with[ENTER]you as an apology and convince him to grind the[ENTER]Foundation Stones into a fine powder.
4625	Calm the Smith
4626	Soothe the smith and convince him to grind the[ENTER]Foundation Stones to a fine powder.
4627	Foundation Stone Powder: 1 piece
4628	What can I do for you? Shall I sharpen your sword?Polish your armour?
4629	No, not today. I am here because the alchemist[ENTER]would like to ask for your forgiveness regarding[ENTER]his sharp tongue earlier. He has sent you this[ENTER]basket of treats.
4630	I am reluctant to do anything for that ungrateful[ENTER]little jerk. But because it is you, I will grind[ENTER]the Foundation Stones. Wait a moment.
4631	Thank you.
4632	Is the smith being stubborn? Give him the basket[ENTER]and ask him to help. He won't be able to say no[ENTER]to you.
4633	The Foundation Stone Powder is ready. Take it to[ENTER]the alchemist.
4634	Oh, as fine as talcum powder. Excellent! The old[ENTER]mule can do it then, hehe. Now I can prepare the[ENTER]Nimbus Tincture and bring it to Yak-Hwan. He will[ENTER]explain the rest to you, when the time comes.[ENTER]Here, take this Passage Ticket! Look after it[ENTER]well, as I am sure you will be needing it soon...
4635	Defeat %s Fireland demons.
4636	Mysterious Fortress
4637	Yak-Hwan is looking for you. Go to him and find[ENTER]out what he wants.
4638	The alchemist has already informed me of my[ENTER]mistake. Hopefully it is not too late to fix it.
4639	I will coat your weapon with Nimbus Tincture. Now[ENTER]if you kill infected demons, the Black Matter[ENTER]inside them will be banished and will not be able[ENTER]to spread.
4640	Now you can also test yourself in the interior of[ENTER]the mysterious fortress. You already have the[ENTER]Passage Ticket. Perhaps there you will uncover a[ENTER]clue to the Servants of Darkness' scheming and[ENTER]also the remains of my missing scout.
4641	
4642	I will head out immediately.
4643	Thank you. Good luck!
4644	Force your way into the fortress and fight the[ENTER]demons inside.[ENTER]Keep your eyes open for the missing scout and any[ENTER]important clues.
4645	In the Fortress
4646	Force your way into the fortress and defeat[ENTER]demons in the interior. Look for clues as to the[ENTER]Servants' scheming and for the missing scout!
4647	You require a group and a Passage Ticket to be[ENTER]able to enter the Red Dragon Fortress.
4648	Were you already in the fortress interior? There[ENTER]has to be some clues as to the scheming of the[ENTER]Servants of Darkness as well as the remains of my[ENTER]scout! Go back to Fireland and search the[ENTER]fortress.
4649	This soldier must be the missing scout! He[ENTER]presses a necklace into your hand. Then, he dies.[ENTER]You find a letter hidden in the necklace. Deliver[ENTER]it to Yak-Hwan.
4650	You have discovered Yak-Hwan's scout.
4651	Is there any news?
4652	
4653	Reading your face makes for bad news... I had[ENTER]feared this already. He was carrying a letter?[ENTER]Show me. There must also be a clue as to the[ENTER]scheming of the Servants of Darkness. Go back and[ENTER]search for it. We'll read the letter later.
4654	You have uncovered a Riveted Necklace belonging[ENTER]to the Servants of Darkness. Show it to Yak-Hwan.
4655	Interesting, the Riveted Necklace belongs to the[ENTER]Servants of Darkness. Perhaps it could be a clue[ENTER]as to their scheming! But still no sign of my[ENTER]scout? Please keep looking for him. He has to be[ENTER]in this fortress.
4656	You have discovered the Riveted Necklace as well[ENTER]as the scout. Report back to Yak-Hwan.
4657	Report to Yak-Hwan.
4658	You were successful then! This Riveted Necklace[ENTER]belongs to the Servants of Darkness. It[ENTER]definitely contains a hidden clue as to their[ENTER]plans. And what is that? A letter from my scout?[ENTER]Show me.
4659	
4660	Here, you're welcome.
4661	Hastily written words:
4662	Yak-Hwan, I will not return alive, but I hope[ENTER]that this letter will get to you. I have come[ENTER]across a fortress in Fireland that is not marked[ENTER]on any map. Its ruler is a powerful Fireland[ENTER]demon – a unique aura surrounds him just as all[ENTER]the other demons in his following.[ENTER]His roar is deafening and he seems to be guarding[ENTER]something. But what that is, I cannot say.[ENTER]Forgive me, I have failed...
4663	We have to find out what is being hidden in this[ENTER]fortress.[ENTER]Look here, on the inside of the Riveted Necklace[ENTER]there is an engraving. I will ask Yon-I-Walker[ENTER]for advice. He will be in touch with you should[ENTER]he need your help.
4664	Decipher the Engraving
4665	Yon-I-Walker is looking for you. Go to him.
4666	Greetings! I could use your help to make this[ENTER]engraving legible.
4667	
4668	The characters on the inside of the Riveted[ENTER]Necklace originate from an ancient culture, that[ENTER]existed a long time ago. To decipher them I need[ENTER]Flame King Blood. It flows through his veins as[ENTER]lava.
4669	Consider it done.
4670	
4671	Acquire Flame King Blood.
4672	We cannot make the engraving legible without[ENTER]Flame King Blood!
4673	You have received Flame King Blood.[ENTER]Return to Yon-I-Walker.
4674	Go to Yon-I-Walker.
4675	Ah, very good. With the blood's help I will be[ENTER]able to make the engraving readable. This[ENTER]requires some time. Return again in the morning.
4676	Wait another %d hrs. %d min.
4677	I need a bit more time. Come back again later!
4678	The Engraving
4679	You have come at the right time! I have[ENTER]deciphered the engraving on the Riveted Necklace.
4680	According to the engraving, the Servants of[ENTER]Darkness have sent out one of the most powerful[ENTER]fire demons to melt the seals of the gates that[ENTER]have held the Great Dragon for thousands of[ENTER]years.[ENTER]This is important information! Please go to[ENTER]Yak-Hwan and report this to him.
4681	
4682	Report to Yak-Hwan.
4683	The Great Dragon
4684	Report the news Yon-I-Walker has told you to[ENTER]Yak-Hwan.
4685	Did Yon-I-Walker decipher the engraving? Very[ENTER]good, let's hear it!
4686	The Great Dragon's seal... aha... The fortress[ENTER]that we discovered must be the legendary Red[ENTER]Dragon Fortress! One of the dragons that the[ENTER]Servants need to kill to obtain the Pearls of the[ENTER]Night is supposed to be imprisoned there. Here,[ENTER]take this Passage Ticket and look after it. You[ENTER]are going to need it soon...
4687	Defeat the Flame King to receive his burning[ENTER]blood!
4688	
4689	Storm the Fortress
4690	Yak-Hwan is looking for you. He wants to let you[ENTER]in on the further planning.
4691	We have barricaded the Red Dragon Fortress. With[ENTER]this, no more infected demons can get out and we[ENTER]can prevent the continued spread of Black Matter.
4692	Head into the Red Dragon Fortress and defeat the[ENTER]army of Ember Flame Demons! Report back to me[ENTER]afterwards.
4693	Understood.
4694	I wish you the best of luck.
4695	Invade the Red Dragon Fortress and defeat the[ENTER]army of Ember Flame Demons!
4696	Charge into the Red Dragon Fortress!
4697	Charge into the Red Dragon Fortress and defeat[ENTER]the army of Ember Flame Demons! Report to[ENTER]Yak-Hwan afterwards.
4698	%s: %d pieces[ENTER]%s: %d pieces
4699	%s: %d pieces[ENTER]%s: %d pieces
4700	Are you giving up already? The army of Ember[ENTER]Flame Demons in the fortress is still too strong.[ENTER]Keep fighting!
4701	You have defeated the army of Ember Flame Demons.[ENTER]Report to Yak-Hwan.
4702	Return to Yak-Hwan.
4703	You are back – and from what I can see, you were[ENTER]successful! What can you tell me?
4704	
4705	A powerful flame demon, you say? That is Razador,[ENTER]Ruler of Fire! If the Servants have sent him,[ENTER]there must be something of great value in the[ENTER]fortress. Perhaps even the legendary red dragon![ENTER]I will talk with my advisers. Here, take this[ENTER]Passage Ticket and look after it. You will need[ENTER]it later.
4706	Black Matter
4707	Yon-I-Walker is looking for you. Go to him to[ENTER]find out more.
4708	So you have survived an encounter with the[ENTER]monstrous Razador. I bow with respect.
4709	
4710	Along with the Frost King Alastor, the ruler of[ENTER]fire belongs to the most evil and deadly[ENTER]underworld creatures that humanity is aware of.[ENTER]Razador may himself be the reason for the Black[ENTER]Matter.
4711	
4712	
4713	This makes him an overwhelming opponent. First[ENTER]defeat the lower ranked demons in the Red Dragon[ENTER]Fortress and gather the Black Matter from their[ENTER]bodies. Ten of them should be sufficient. Perhaps[ENTER]we will find a way to neutralise their power[ENTER]before we then face Razador.
4714	I'll head out on my way immediately.
4715	Fight the Ember Flame Demons in the Red Dragon[ENTER]Fortress.
4716	Black Matter
4717	Storm the Red Dragon Fortress, fight the Ember[ENTER]Flame Demons and gather ten pieces of Black[ENTER]Matter.
4718	You require a group and a Passage Ticket to be[ENTER]able to enter the Red Dragon Fortress.
4719	That is not enough. I need ten pieces of Black[ENTER]Matter for my research.
4720	You have gather ten pieces of Black Matter. Take[ENTER]them to Yon-I-Walker.
4721	Even the sight of Black Matter makes me shudder![ENTER]Very well, to work... I will call for you when I[ENTER]am successful.
4722	
4723	Black Matter Neutralisation
4724	Good news! I have found out how the power of[ENTER]Black Matter can be neutralised.
4725	
4726	All powers of nature have a counterpart – light[ENTER]and dark, fire and water, good and evil. Even[ENTER]Black Matter has a counterpart, something which[ENTER]has the power to neutralise it: Pure Lumen!
4727	To produce Pure Lumen, you need to melt Energy[ENTER]Fragments in Mong Water. Could you gather 50[ENTER]bottles of Mong Water as well as 100 Energy[ENTER]Fragments and then take them to Yu-Hwan? Thank[ENTER]you.
4728	I'm on it.
4729	Gather 50 bottles of Mong Water as well as 100[ENTER]Energy Fragments and take them to Yu-Hwan.
4730	Pure Lumen
4731	Gather 50 bottles of Mong Water as well as 100[ENTER]Energy Fragments and take them to Yu-Hwan.
4732	Woah, Yon-I-Walker had already warned me that you[ENTER]would be coming. Well, let's get to work. Why[ENTER]don't you relax in the meantime?
4733	Woah, Yon-I-Walker had already warned me that you[ENTER]would be coming. I'd like to get to work, but the[ENTER]materials are not yet sufficient to produce Pure[ENTER]Lumen. Go out and keep gathering.
4734	You have enough Mong Water and Energy Fragments.[ENTER]Take them to Yu-Hwan.
4735	Go to Yu-Hwan.
4736	Deliver the Pure Lumen
4737	Yu-Hwan has produced the Pure Lumen. Go to him.
4738	There you are! At exactly the right time. The[ENTER]Pure Lumen has just now been finished. Report the[ENTER]news to Yak-Hwan.
4739	
4740	
4741	
4742	Tell Yak-Hwan that the production of Pure Lumen[ENTER]has come to fruition.
4743	Are you still here? Please tell Yak-Hwan that the[ENTER]production of Pure Lumen has come to fruition.
4744	Ah, welcome! The production of Pure Lumen has[ENTER]been completed? Fantastic!
4745	
4746	Impressive. With that we now have an ace in the[ENTER]hole where it comes to the fight for Red Dragon[ENTER]Fortress. Take some time to relax whilst I gather[ENTER]the troops.
4747	Go to Yon-I-Walker.
4748	Storm the Red Dragon Fortress
4749	Yak-Hwan is calling for you. He will give you the[ENTER]final briefing before you head into battle.
4750	It is time. The battle has begun. I have send a[ENTER]troop to Red Dragon Fortress. All men are[ENTER]equipped with Pure Lumen. Their wits have become[ENTER]razor sharp. The effect is tremendous!
4751	Follow the attack troops to the Red Dragon[ENTER]Fortress and talk with one of my men.
4752	
4753	Follow the attack troops to the Red Dragon[ENTER]Fortress.
4754	To the Fortress!
4755	Follow the attack troops to the Red Dragon[ENTER]Fortress and talk with one of the soldiers.
4756	You are still here? Go, follow my men to the Red[ENTER]Dragon Fortress!
4757	We... we stormed the fortress. At first it was[ENTER]going well, but then... we had no chance. The[ENTER]opposing demon army outnumbered us. All of my[ENTER]comrades have fallen. Please report this to[ENTER]Yak-Hwan! I...
4758	Report the events in the Red Dragon Fortress to[ENTER]Yak-Hwan.
4759	You're back already? What... something went wrong?Talk!
4760	
4761	The whole battalion fell? Oh, no... this is all[ENTER]my fault. The attack took place too hastily and[ENTER]my men have paid the price with their deaths.
4762	
4763	I need to rethink my strategy. There has to be[ENTER]another way to eliminate these demons. Get ready.[ENTER]I will call for you as soon as I have a plan.
4764	Step by Step
4765	Good that you are here. We have decided to attack[ENTER]the demons first and weaken them, before we try[ENTER]to attack Razador again.
4766	Storm the Red Dragon Fortress and weaken the[ENTER]Ember Flame Demons' defences.
4767	Defeat 1,000 Flame Demons to severely weaken[ENTER]Razador's lines of defence.
4768	To Arms!
4769	Storm the Red Dragon Fortress and defeat 1,000[ENTER]Flame Demons.
4770	Step 1: 1,000 Demons
4771	Storm the Red Dragon Fortress and defeat 1,000[ENTER]Flame Demons.
4772	You require a group and a Passage Ticket to be[ENTER]able to enter the Red Dragon Fortress.
4773	The enemy defence lines are still too strong.[ENTER]Defeat more demons. We are counting on you!
4774	You have defeated 1,000 Flame Demons. Report to[ENTER]Yak-Hwan.
4775	Good work! You have severely weakened the Flame[ENTER]Demon defence lines.[ENTER]I will inform you when we are going to proceed.
4776	Step 2
4777	It is time for the next step. Now we need to[ENTER]attack the high-ranking demon warriors.[ENTER]Storm into the Red Dragon Fortress once again and[ENTER]defeat 50 each of the Ember Flame Kings, Ember[ENTER]Flame Beards, Ember Flame Trolls, Ember Flame[ENTER]Generals and Ember Flame Chieftains.
4778	
4779	Storm into the Red Dragon Fortress once again and[ENTER]defeat 50 each of the Ember Flame Kings, Ember[ENTER]Flame Beards, Ember Flame Trolls, Ember Flame[ENTER]Generals and Ember Flame Chieftains.
4780	Step 2: High-ranking Demons
4781	Storm into the Red Dragon Fortress once again and[ENTER]defeat 50 each of the Ember Flame Kings, Ember[ENTER]Flame Beards, Ember Flame Trolls, Ember Flame[ENTER]Generals and Ember Flame Chieftains.
4782	The enemy troops are still too strong.[ENTER]You have yet to defeat enough high-ranking Ember[ENTER]Flame Demons. Return to the fortress and keep[ENTER]fighting!
4783	You have defeated the high-ranking Ember Flame[ENTER]Demons. Report to Yak-Hwan.
4784	Fantastic! The ranks of Ember Flame Demons have[ENTER]been weakened and my men can now storm the Red[ENTER]Dragon Fortress. Good work! As soon as I have[ENTER]news, I'll let you know.
4785	Step 3
4786	My men are now inside the Red Dragon Fortress and[ENTER]thanks to your preparatory work the losses on our[ENTER]side are within limits. Yon-I-Walker will explain[ENTER]the next part of our strategy to you. Go to him.
4787	Go to Yon-I-Walker and listen to his strategy.
4788	Go to Yon-I-Walker and listen to his strategy.
4789	I have been expecting you. We are close to being[ENTER]able to once again frustrate the plans of the[ENTER]Servants of Darkness. Let me explain what our[ENTER]next step is.
4790	Through our spies we have discovered that Razador[ENTER]generates a large part of his power from the[ENTER]Purgatory Fire Metin. He has had this stone[ENTER]brought to the Red Dragon Fortress, where it is[ENTER]heavily guarded. Destroy this Metin! This will[ENTER]make the fight against Razador considerably[ENTER]easier.
4791	
4792	We do not know where exactly the Purgatory Fire[ENTER]Metin is. But it has to be somewhere in this[ENTER]fortress! Once you have attained your goal,[ENTER]report back to Yak-Hwan.
4793	
4794	Destroy the Purgatory Fire Metin in the Red[ENTER]Dragon Fortress.
4795	Step 3: Destroy the Metin
4796	Head out on the hunt for the Purgatory Fire Metin[ENTER]in the Red Dragon Fortress and destroy it.
4797	Remaining
4798	We need to destroy the Purgatory Fire Metin, or[ENTER]the fight against Razador will be futile. Go, you[ENTER]can do it!
4799	You have destroyed the Purgatory Fire Metin.[ENTER]Report to Yak-Hwan.
4800	Good work. This time we will annihilate Razador![ENTER]Here, take the Pure Lumen and this Passage Ticket.Look after both of them, as you will have use for[ENTER]them later. Now take some time to relax.
4801	Defeat %s Ember Flame Demons.
4802	The Fight Against Razador
4803	Go to Yak-Hwan and listen to his battle plan.
4804	The day of triumph is close enough to touch![ENTER]This time we are prepared and we will defeat[ENTER]Razador.
4805	Do you still have the Pure Lumen? Note that its[ENTER]effects only last for an hour. So take it just[ENTER]before the battle begins. To arms!
4806	Understood.
4807	Storm the Red Dragon Fortress and defeat Razador.
4808	The Fight Against Razador
4809	Charge into the Red Dragon Fortress and defeat[ENTER]Razador, Ruler of Fire.
4810	You require a group and a Passage Ticket to be[ENTER]able to enter the Red Dragon Fortress.
4811	It won't be easy to take on Razador. But we have[ENTER]no other choice if we want to stop the plans of[ENTER]the Servants of the Darkness. Generate new[ENTER]strength and face up to the Ruler of Fire, before[ENTER]it is too late!
4812	Mortal, heed my words! Enjoy your short-lived[ENTER]view of triumph. It will not last for long. The[ENTER]red dragon will break from his chains. With his[ENTER]power I will return to your pitiful world to[ENTER]complete my task.
4813	Razador, Ruler of Fire, has been defeated. Report[ENTER]to Yak-Hwan.
4814	Go back to Yak-Hwan.
4815	What a triumph! Never before has someone managed[ENTER]to get the better of the Ruler of Fire. This[ENTER]truly is a great day.
4816	
4817	What do you say? The red dragon will allow[ENTER]Razador to rise again? How is that possible? We[ENTER]know little of the great dragons... but the[ENTER]extent of their power seems to be enormous.
4818	Thwarting Plans I
4819	Bad news! Razador has arisen through the power of[ENTER]the red dragon. His powers have grown as a result[ENTER]and the influence of Black Matter seems to be[ENTER]greater than ever before.
4820	Talk with Yon-I-Walker. He knows how you can[ENTER]defeat Razador for once and for all.
4821	Go to Yon-I-Walker and find out how Razador can[ENTER]be defeated for good.
4822	Talk to Yon-I-Walker.
4823	Go to Yon-I-Walker and find out how Razador can[ENTER]be defeated for good.
4824	You haven't been to see Yon-I-Walker yet? How do[ENTER]you propose to defeat Razador?! Go! What are you[ENTER]waiting for!
4825	Yes, it is true. Razador is back – and even more[ENTER]agitated than ever before. We only have one[ENTER]option to stop the Servants of the Darkness from[ENTER]carrying out their plan...
4826	Razador will not rest before he has completed his[ENTER]task and has freed the red dragon. To stop this,[ENTER]we will have to banish the dragon.
4827	
4828	The element of the red dragon is fire... and fire[ENTER]can be best fought with – fire! Every Ember Flame[ENTER]Demon wears a ring of magma around their heart.[ENTER]Bring me five of these Magma Rings!
4829	Storm the Red Dragon Fortress and gather Magma[ENTER]Rings.
4830	Gather Magma Rings from the Ember Flame Demons.[ENTER]Yon-I-Walker needs five of them. As they cool[ENTER]quickly, you should gather more than the required[ENTER]amount.
4831	That is not quite enough Magma Rings. I require[ENTER]%d more.
4832	Good, now I have all the Magma Rings I require.[ENTER]They need to cool down a little bit so that I can[ENTER]work on them. If I need your help, I will be in[ENTER]touch.
4833	Hmm, these Magma Rings are already cold. I cannot[ENTER]use them anymore. Bring me fresh ones.
4834	Thwarting Plans II
4835	Yon-I-Walker is looking for you. Go to him.
4836	I will need a little bit more time, until the[ENTER]Magma Rings have cooled to the point where they[ENTER]can be worked on. Could you collect me some Dok[ENTER]Water in the meantime? I can then dissolve the[ENTER]Magma Rings in it.
4837	The mixture that is then created is known as[ENTER]Arden Aqua. It possesses the power to banish the[ENTER]red dragon![ENTER]Yak-Hwan will let you know the full details later.Please now gather 100 bottles of Dok Water for me.
4838	Find 100 bottles of Dok Water and bring them to[ENTER]Yon-I-Walker.
4839	Find 100 bottles of Dok Water and bring them to[ENTER]Yon-I-Walker.
4840	Very good. Now I will get to producing the Arden[ENTER]Aqua.
4841	
4842	I am missing one final ingredient. But I have to[ENTER]concentrate on the melting process. We cannot[ENTER]afford any mistakes! I will be in touch later.
4843	That isn't quite 100 bottles of Dok Water yet.[ENTER]Please bring me more.
4844	You have gathered 100 bottles of Dok Water. Now[ENTER]return to Yon-I-Walker.
4845	Go to Yon-I-Walker.
4846	Thwarting Plans III
4847	The Arden Aqua production is running smoothly.[ENTER]Yet I need your help once again.
4848	Now I need Manticore Leather from the wing skin[ENTER]of Martyaxwar, leader of the manticores. Gather[ENTER]five of them!
4849	Gather five pieces of Manticore Leather from[ENTER]Martyaxwar. Bring it to Yon-I-Walker.
4850	Gather five pieces of Manticore Leather from[ENTER]Martyaxwar. Bring it to Yon-I-Walker.
4851	We are so close to our goal – don't give up now.[ENTER]Bring me the Manticore Leather!
4852	Perfect, now I have everything that I need. Wait[ENTER]a second... ah, the Ring of Samael! A powerful[ENTER]artefact that will banish the red dragon. Here,[ENTER]take these three rings and bring them to[ENTER]Yak-Hwan.[ENTER]Additionally, here is a Passage Ticket from[ENTER]myself. Look after it well, for you will have use[ENTER]of it later.
4853	You have gathered all pieces of Manticore Leather.[ENTER]Bring them to Yon-I-Walker.
4854	Battle Begins
4855	Get ready – the battle is beginning. Yak-Hwan has[ENTER]a final briefing for you.
4856	It is time. Our troops are ready. The battle can[ENTER]start. Do you have the Ring of Samael with you?
4857	Yep, here it is.
4858	Ah very good. I will explain how you can use it[ENTER]later. But first we need to break through the[ENTER]newly formed flame demon defence lines. Head to[ENTER]the Red Dragon Fortress and defeat:[ENTER]10 Ember Flame Kings[ENTER]10 Ember Flame Beards[ENTER]10 Ember Flame Trolls[ENTER]10 Ember Flame Generals[ENTER]10 Ember Flame Chieftains
4859	
4860	Understood.
4861	Weaken the defences of the Ember Flame Demons.
4862	Start of the Offensive
4863	Storm the Red Dragon Fortress!
4864	You require a group and a Passage Ticket to be[ENTER]able to enter the Red Dragon Fortress.
4865	We have not yet been able to break through the[ENTER]enemy defence lines. Defeat all of the required[ENTER]Ember Flame Demons.
4866	You have defeated all of the Ember Flame Demons.[ENTER]Report back to Yak-Hwan.
4867	Return to Yak-Hwan.
4868	You have done well. We have gotten another step[ENTER]closer to our goal – the red dragon will not be a[ENTER]threat to us for much longer!
4869	Old Grudge, New Battle
4870	Your arch-enemy, Razador, seems to resent the[ENTER]fact that you killed him. His roar sounds louder[ENTER]than ever before across the plains of Doyyumhwan.
4871	It is time to silence him once again. As he[ENTER]stands, with eagle eyes, above the gate behind[ENTER]which the red dragon is held. Be wary of him! He[ENTER]will have learnt from his defeat and will not[ENTER]make the same mistakes twice.
4872	Defeat Razador, Ruler of Fire.
4873	Play with Fire
4874	Defeat Razador, Ruler of Fire, in the Red Dragon[ENTER]Fortress.
4875	Was Razador too much for you this time? I can[ENTER]hardly believe it! You managed it once – you will[ENTER]manage it this time too!
4876	Razador has been defeated. Report back to[ENTER]Yak-Hwan.
4877	I knew that you would be able to do it! I will[ENTER]now make preparations for the banishment ritual.[ENTER]As soon as we are ready, I will call for you.
4878	The Red Dragon
4879	It is time. Everything is ready to banish the red[ENTER]dragon.
4880	The red dragon's prison was sealed by the Taramor[ENTER]Gravestone. Throw the Ring of Samael on it and[ENTER]the banishment ritual will be complete!
4881	Throw the Ring of Samael onto the Taramor[ENTER]Gravestone to complete the banishment ritual.
4882	Remaining
4883	Banishment Rites
4884	Throw the Ring of Samael on the Taramor[ENTER]Gravestone to banish the red dragon.
4885	Taramor Gravestone: 1 piece
4886	Spectacle of Fire
4887	Was that all, you worm?! That was at most a[ENTER]tickle – you haven't banished me with that! I[ENTER]will fetch Razador back from the realms of the[ENTER]dead once again. He will free me from my[ENTER]imprisonment and you will get to feel my wrath!
4888	The banishment of the red dragon failed.[ENTER]Report to Yak-Hwan.
4889	The ritual failed? The red dragon must be more[ENTER]powerful than we first thought...
4890	
4891	You did some great work, there's no blame on you.[ENTER]I will not rest until we have found a way to[ENTER]banish the red dragon! But that will take time. I[ENTER]thank you for all that you have done for us.
4892	Run into the Fire
4893	Yak-Hwan is looking for you. Go to him and find[ENTER]out what he wants.
4894	Welcome back! We should have been granted even[ENTER]just the smallest of breaks – the Servants of[ENTER]Darkness are back in action. That cannot be good.
4895	
4896	However, my information is very vague. All we[ENTER]know is that they are holed up in Fireland.
4897	We have already sent out a scout. But recently he[ENTER]broke off contact with us and I am very[ENTER]concerned.[ENTER]Can you take a look for him on your way to[ENTER]Fireland?
4898	Of course.
4899	Thanks. I'll mark his last known location on the[ENTER]map for you. Good luck!
4900	Take a look around Fireland for the missing scout.[ENTER]Coordinates: %d,%d
4901	Explore Fireland!
4902	Travel to Fireland. Search for the scout there[ENTER]and any clues as to the scheming of the Servants[ENTER]of Darkness.
4903	There must be something at this location. Perhaps[ENTER]you overlooked a clue. Keep searching.
4904	No trace of the scout. Return and report to[ENTER]Yak-Hwan.
4905	Yak-Hwan is waiting on Dark Dragon Rock for your[ENTER]report.
4906	You're back! Have you uncovered anything?
4907	Unfortunately there was no trace of the scout.[ENTER]But there was a fortress there, that I hadn't[ENTER]noticed before. A powerful aura flows out from[ENTER]within the walls and is affecting the[ENTER]surroundings.
4908	Hmm, I do not like that at all. I will find out[ENTER]more about this fortress and then get back in[ENTER]touch with you.
4909	Investigate the Fortress
4910	We are in the dark. Up till now I have been[ENTER]unable to find out anything about this mysterious[ENTER]fortress. Go to Yon-I-Walker and ask him for[ENTER]advice. He will help you.
4911	Go to Yon-I-Walker.
4912	What can I do for you? What do you say? A[ENTER]mysterious fortress, from which an aura flows...[ENTER]Interesting... Good. Well then, let us see if we[ENTER]can bring some light to the darkness.
4913	
4914	I have a suspicion about what this aura is.[ENTER]Wait, I will coat your weapon with a special[ENTER]tincture.
4915	Return to Fireland now and kill demons that are[ENTER]in the vicinity of the fortress. If my suspicions[ENTER]are confirmed, your weapon will colour black if[ENTER]the demons are under the influence of the aura.
4916	Defeat demons that are roaming around the[ENTER]fortress.
4917	Demon Hunt
4918	Defeat Fireland demons that are roaming around in[ENTER]the vicinity of the fortress and check to see if[ENTER]your weapon colours.
4919	Hmm, I am certain that there is evidence of this[ENTER]aura to be found in Fireland. Return back there[ENTER]once more and defeat demons, that are in close[ENTER]proximity to this fortress.
4920	Your weapon has coloured black. Return back to[ENTER]Yon-I-Walker.
4921	Ah, just as I expected! That is highly remarkable!Let me take a sample of the demon blood on your[ENTER]weapon. I will let you know when I know more.
4922	Enlighten the Mind
4923	Yon-I-Walker is looking for you. Go to him to[ENTER]find out more.
4924	Ah, there you are! The aura is treacherous and is[ENTER]clouding my mind.[ENTER]I need Sun Herbs to lighten my mind and to[ENTER]continue my investigations. Can you get me some?
4925	Sure.
4926	The Sun Herbs grow in hot, dry locations – they[ENTER]can be found in Fireland all year round. I'll[ENTER]mark the last location I found some on the map.[ENTER]Although I'm not entirely certain that was the[ENTER]actual location...
4927	I'll head out there right away.
4928	Go to the marked location in Fireland and search[ENTER]for Sun Herbs.
4929	Sun Herbs
4930	Go to the location that Yon-I-Walker has marked[ENTER]on the map and search there for Sun Herbs.
4931	You return with empty hands? That is not good. I[ENTER]feel as if my mind is getting more and more[ENTER]clouded by the aura. Please get me some Sun[ENTER]Herbs.
4932	You have found the Sun Herbs. Take them to[ENTER]Yon-I-Walker.
4933	Ah, you have found the Sun Herbs![ENTER]Excellent. Now I can continue my investigations.[ENTER]Yak-Hwan will let you know about the results.
4934	The adventure continues as soon as you have[ENTER]reached level %d.
4935	Welcome to Metin2
4936	The exciting adventures of Metin2 are about to[ENTER]begin. For starters, please find the City Guard.[ENTER]He will provide you with some basic information[ENTER]and various assignments.[ENTER][ENTER]If you would like to go hunting, you will find[ENTER]wild animals on the outskirts of the village[ENTER]borders. They will be shown on the minimap as red[ENTER]dots. You should concentrate on the Wild Dogs[ENTER]first, as they are the easiest targets.[ENTER]Good luck!
4937	Locate the City Guard
4938	Locate the City Guard
4939	Talk to the City Guard by clicking on him. He's[ENTER]the NPC that the arrow is pointing at. If you[ENTER]can't see him, you might be too far away. Follow[ENTER]the blinking circles on the map until you reach[ENTER]the City Guard.
4940	City Guard:
4941	You must be new in town! I see they haven't made[ENTER]you a soldier yet. Have you had any training at[ENTER]all yet? Look at yourself! Have you ever even[ENTER]used a weapon? Listen up! You have to be careful[ENTER]if you want to survive this war. I'm going to[ENTER]assist you until you have reached level 10. And[ENTER]don't be fooled into thinking that it's going to[ENTER]be easy! Now move!
4942	Now go and learn some basics for combat and[ENTER]hunting! Once you have reached a higher level,[ENTER]return to the village and talk to me again. Why[ENTER]are you still standing here? You won't get[ENTER]experience by just standing around!
4944	You have received 9,500 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 2,000 Yang.
4943	Go to the Captain
4945	The Captain's training
4946	The Captain's first mission takes you to the[ENTER]neighbouring village. There you should visit the[ENTER]musician Yu-Hwan and ask for the secret documents[ENTER]for the Captain.
4947	Musician Yu-Hwan:
4948	Life is a dream, just like everything else. Where[ENTER]do we come from and where do we go? The world is[ENTER]full of conflict. Honest work never pays off...[ENTER]Are you here to listen to my song?
4949	Oh, the Captain sent you! Psst, lower your[ENTER]voice... Nobody in the village can find out my[ENTER]true identity. Here, take this. This document[ENTER]contains all the important information that I was[ENTER]able to find out. Take it to the Captain.
4950	Musician Yu-Hwan:
4951	Hurry up and leave! If you stand around here for[ENTER]too long, something bad will happen. Remember:[ENTER]Life is short, so enjoy for as long as you can.
4952	Return to the Captain
4953	The musician Yu-Hwan who secretly works as a spy[ENTER]has given you important documents.[ENTER]Take them to the Captain in the first village.
4955	This is the document from the musician? Not bad[ENTER]for a new adventurer! I expect great things of[ENTER]you. Take this as a reward for your work. Keep up[ENTER]the good work for your country!
4954	You're now experienced enough to serve your[ENTER]kingdom as a fully fledged warrior. From now on[ENTER]the Captain will give you new assignments. You'll[ENTER]find him in the first village. Go and see him,[ENTER]he's waiting for you.
4956	Captain:
4957	You look familiar.... Oh yes, I think I have[ENTER]heard of you. You're the new adventurer and you[ENTER]have done well in proving your skills. I don't[ENTER]know yet exactly how skilled you are, but you're[ENTER]going to be tested in future assignments.
4958	There are challenges ahead, so get prepared for[ENTER]them. Do you know the story of the three[ENTER]kingdoms? Or the story of the continent Lightning[ENTER]Heaven? You don't know it!? What do the[ENTER]instructors teach these days? Do I really have to[ENTER]teach you such fundamental stuff?
4959	This is important, as it is the history of the[ENTER]continent. So I'm going to summarise it for you.[ENTER]Once upon a time, the kingdom was united. But[ENTER]then the Metin Stones came down and brought war[ENTER]and conflict. The continent was divided into[ENTER]three individual countries: Shinsoo is the[ENTER]kingdom of trade, Chunjo is the kingdom of[ENTER]religion and Jinno is the kingdom of military.
4960	Every kingdom is desperately trying to recover[ENTER]from the uprisings that came about after the[ENTER]Metin Stones came down. A lot of people want the[ENTER]continent to be reunified. You should also fight[ENTER]for it! Never forget that.
4961	I'm going to give you your first assignment.[ENTER]Relax, it's an easy one. In the next village, you[ENTER]will find a musician called Yu-Hwan. People say[ENTER]that he quit the army to become a musician.[ENTER]But really, he's a secret spy, who gets hold of[ENTER]secret documents. There's a document that I need[ENTER]from him. Bring it to me. And don't forget that[ENTER]this is a secret mission.
4962	Press the M key to figure out how to get to the[ENTER]next village on the map. Use the warp portal[ENTER]indicated by the corresponding village name.[ENTER]Hurry up! Yu-Hwan is very tall - but you'll be[ENTER]able to recognise him by the instruments he has[ENTER]with him.
4964	Kill Alpha Grey Wolves:
4963	The Captain has a new assignment for you. Go talk[ENTER]to him.
4965	Do you want to quit the quest?
4966	So you made it? Well done! You did not have too[ENTER]much trouble, I hope? Anyway, let's move on to[ENTER]the next step.
4967	Find the Captain
4968	Task completed
4969	Task completed
4970	You have killed the required number of Alpha Grey[ENTER]Wolves. Now go back to the Captain and report[ENTER]your success.
4971	Did you kill the Alpha Grey Wolves? Good work.[ENTER]Thanks to you, it's a lot easier to keep the[ENTER]village safe now. That's really good news for a[ENTER]change in times of war like these.
4972	You have received 24,000 experience points and[ENTER]3,500 Yang.
4973	Several Alpha Grey Wolves have been causing[ENTER]mayhem just outside the village. They have been[ENTER]running wild for a while, but now their behaviour[ENTER]is getting completely out of hand! They have[ENTER]started attacking the village and the people on[ENTER]the streets. To regain control of the situation,[ENTER]we have to kill some Alpha Grey Wolves. Could you[ENTER]help? Eliminate 10 Alpha Grey Wolves for us.
4974	You will receive 24,000 experience points and[ENTER]3,500 Yang in reward.
4975	Kill 10 Alpha Grey Wolves
4976	The Alpha Grey Wolves are attacking the village.[ENTER]To get the situation under control, you have to[ENTER]kill 10 of them.
4977	So far, you have killed %s Alpha Grey Wolves.
4978	Remaining number
4979	You have killed all 10 Alpha Grey Wolves. Return[ENTER]to the Captain.
4980	Kill Alpha Grey Wolves
4981	What, you still haven't finished the task?[ENTER]Are you having trouble killing 10 Alpha Grey[ENTER]Wolves? If you want to keep fighting for your[ENTER]kingdom you should keep trying.
4983	Task completed
4982	The Captain has a new task for you. Go talk to[ENTER]him.
4984	You have destroyed a Metin of Battle. Go to the[ENTER]Captain and tell him of your success.
4985	Nice work! You've become a very reliable helper![ENTER]Now I know I can trust you with any assignment.[ENTER]I'm proud to have you working with us. Here is[ENTER]your reward and keep up the good work!
4986	You have received 48,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 10,000 Yang.
4987	You have received a %s.
4988	I know about the dark energy of the Metin stones.[ENTER]The musician Yu-Hwan told me that the Metin[ENTER]stones make the animals go berserk and spread[ENTER]terrible diseases.
4989	If we don't do anything about the Metin stones,[ENTER]the animals will attack the villagers again or[ENTER]worse; a disease might break out! Could you take[ENTER]care of the stones that have landed outside the[ENTER]village?
4990	You will receive 48,000 experience points and[ENTER]10,000 Yang, plus a Spirit Stone (+0 to +2) in[ENTER]reward.
4991	Destroy the Metin of Battle
4992	The Metin Stones are a serious danger. Help the[ENTER]Captain and destroy a Metin of Battle.
4993	Task completed
4994	You have destroyed the Metin of Battle. Talk to[ENTER]the Captain.
4995	Return to the Captain
4997	Our kingdom, Jinno, has always been a strong[ENTER]military power. The emperor unified the continent[ENTER]with his powerful and tried and tested cavalry.[ENTER]Even though we are now divided due to the riots[ENTER]that the Metin Stones caused, our kingdom still[ENTER]rightfully owns the power of Iryung.
4996	The current situation
4998	We still have the most powerful army of the three[ENTER]kingdoms, even though there is nothing we can do[ENTER]about the Metin stones right now. If we really[ENTER]wanted to, we could easily conquer the other[ENTER]kingdoms. You should train hard to become a good[ENTER]soldier!
4999	I'm going to give you a new assignment. Take this[ENTER]ammunition to Yu-Hwan in the neighbouring[ENTER]village. We store this munition in several places[ENTER]for extra security, so that we can quickly access[ENTER]it in an emergency. If you deliver this to[ENTER]Yu-Hwan, you'll be helping to arm the village.
5000	You have received 45,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 10,000 Yang.
5001	The current situation
5002	The Captain has entrusted you with a delivery for[ENTER]Yu-Hwan. Take to him in the Second Village.
5003	Once upon a time, there was a bloody battle[ENTER]between Sung Mahi and the Dragon God. Since then,[ENTER]the people have been divided and are competing[ENTER]against each other in never ending wars... You[ENTER]again! Do you need something? The Captain has[ENTER]sent me something important? Thanks. And now be[ENTER]on your way again - it's not good if people see[ENTER]us together.
5004	Talk to the Captain
5005	You have given Yu-Hwan the Captain's delivery.[ENTER]Now go back to the Captain and pick up your[ENTER]reward.
5006	Well done! If you carry on like this, you could[ENTER]become a really important helper for our village.[ENTER]Here is your reward.
5007	As you may have heard, the peace situation[ENTER]between kingdoms isn't good at the moment. Go to[ENTER]the Captain, he can give you more information.
5008	I think you should find out more about our[ENTER]current situation. Direct your attention to our[ENTER]kingdom first. To win a war, you need to know[ENTER]yourself before you get to know your enemies.
5009	Our kingdom, Shinsoo, has always been a centre of[ENTER]trade. Our extensive trade routes brought loads[ENTER]of merchants and goods over to us from all over[ENTER]the world. But since the Metin Stones came down,[ENTER]these relations have broken down and our economy[ENTER]has got much worse. We were prosperous once, but[ENTER]we never had much military power, which is why we[ENTER]have hired some mercenaries. These fighters are[ENTER]very reliable and loyal to those who pay them.
5010	Thanks to the mercenaries, our country has[ENTER]regained its stability. But to be prepared for[ENTER]future wars, we need more mercenaries and a[ENTER]strong economy. This isn't going to be easy for[ENTER]any of us.
5011	I have another task for you. Take this speciality[ENTER]to Yu-Hwan, who lives in the neighbouring[ENTER]village. Our country was and still is a kingdom[ENTER]of commerce and so we trade with different[ENTER]specialities from different regions. The returns[ENTER]we get from it benefit the village.
5012	Our kingdom, Chunjo, is ruled by governor[ENTER]Yoon-Young and was founded on strong religious[ENTER]beliefs. Because of this, we knew about the[ENTER]presence of Sung Mahi long before anyone else[ENTER]did. Our Shamans prepared us for the appearance[ENTER]of the Metin Stones. Without them, the protection[ENTER]of our country would never have been secured.[ENTER]Their belief gives them skills that normal humans[ENTER]will never have. And without the Shamans it would[ENTER]only be a matter of time until another country[ENTER]defeated us.
5013	The people of our country have a very strong[ENTER]faith and pray to the Dragon God every day. The[ENTER]benevolent Dragon God is protecting us from the[ENTER]resurrection of Sung Mahi. With his help we are[ENTER]going to keep defending ourselves from these[ENTER]barbaric attacks and reunite the empire under our[ENTER]control.
5014	I'm going to give you a new assignment. Deliver[ENTER]this stone statue of the Dragon God to Yu-Hwan in[ENTER]the neighbouring village. Religion and our deep[ENTER]faith in the Dragon God are very important to our[ENTER]kingdom. If you deliver this to Yu-Hwan, you will[ENTER]be doing the villagers a big favour.
5016	You have received 100,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 5,000 Yang.
5015	Capture the spy
5017	Capture the spy
5018	there is an enemy spy in our village. The Captain[ENTER]will give you more information about it.
5019	I have a feeling that we have a spy in our midst.[ENTER]Someone from the villagers' ranks is in collusion[ENTER]with the White Oath Soldiers. I need your help in[ENTER]this matter: Go and kill White Oath Soldiers,[ENTER]perhaps you'll be able to find some information[ENTER]about the spy.
5020	You will receive 100,000 experience points and[ENTER]5,000 Yang in reward.
5021	Expose the spy
5022	The Captain suspects a spy in the White Oath[ENTER]Village. Kill White Oath Soldiers until you find[ENTER]some evidence of the spy.
5023	You've found a letter.[ENTER]Take it to the Captain.
5024	You have found a Letter with the White Oath[ENTER]Soldiers. Maybe this is the evidence of the Spy[ENTER]the Captain is looking for. Take the letter to[ENTER]the Captain.
5025	Did you find any evidence? A Letter? Let me take[ENTER]a look... It could be enough to find out who the[ENTER]spy is. Thanks to you we should be able to get[ENTER]rid of this problem. Well done! You should have a[ENTER]rest. Take this as a token of my gratitude.
5027	First exercise
5026	What are you doing?
5028	First exercise:
5029	Kill 9 Wild Dogs. You'll find them directly in[ENTER]front of the City Gates.
5030	So far you have killed %s wild dogs.
5031	Remaining number
5032	First practice task completed.
5033	You have killed all 9 wild dogs. Report back to[ENTER]the City Guard.
5034	About the first task...
5035	If you have a problem with killing 9 Wild Dogs,[ENTER]you aren't really a true adventurer are you?
5036	Exercise task:
5037	Do you want to give up the quest for good?[ENTER]It will be deleted from your mission overview and[ENTER]will not be available again.
5038	How did you do that? You didn't cheat, did you?[ENTER]Anyway, let's get to the next step.
5040	Practice task completed
5039	City guard:[ENTER]Your interest is commendable but you should[ENTER]collect more experience points. Come back once[ENTER]you've reached a higher level!
5041	You are better than I thought! But I suppose[ENTER]anyone could have done that. Ha ha! Back in my[ENTER]days, the assignments were much more difficult.[ENTER]Be prepared for the next one. Here, you've earned[ENTER]yourself some potions and Yang with which you can[ENTER]improve your equipment. I'll call you as soon as[ENTER]I have a new assignment for you.
5042	You have received 550 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 1,000 Yang.
5043	You have received %s, %s units.
5044	Letter from the City Guard
5045	Find the City Guard
5046	If you're reading this message, then you have[ENTER]reached a new level! Congratulations! Now go to[ENTER]the City Guard to receive you first training[ENTER]session!
5047	You still lack discipline, though you've at least[ENTER]shown me that you can handle a weapon! Do you[ENTER]really think you're ready to take on wild[ENTER]animals? I'm going to check how skilful you are[ENTER]first. Leave the village and kill 9 Wild Dogs,[ENTER]then come afterwards and get your reward.
5048	Wild Dogs are not very strong, so it shouldn't be[ENTER]too difficult. If you can't manage this task, you[ENTER]won't survive for very long! Get going! The[ENTER]sooner you start, the sooner you'll be done!
5049	From time to time the Villagers give you[ENTER]assignments which give you experience points and[ENTER]Yang. It pays to look out for people who give you[ENTER]assignments!
5050	For killing the Wild Dogs you will receive:[ENTER]Experience points: 550[ENTER]Yang: 1,000[ENTER]Item: %s, Quantity: %s
5051	Wild Dogs:
5053	The Metin Stone has been destroyed
5054	You have destroyed the Metin of Black. Go to the[ENTER]Captain and tell him about your success.
5052	Destroy the Metin Stones
5055	Did you destroy the Metin Stone? Thank you! The[ENTER]village is safe for the time being now! Where[ENTER]have these stones come from anyway? We barely[ENTER]have any information about them, even though they[ENTER]are causing so many problems. I heard that Uriel[ENTER]the wise was investigating the Metin Stones. But[ENTER]I don't know what he has found out so far.[ENTER]Either way, you did a good job!
5056	Reward:
5057	You have received 1,000,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 15,000 Yang.
5058	You have received: %s
5059	The destruction caused by the Metin Stones is[ENTER]becoming worse. The Metin Stones need to be[ENTER]destroyed. Go to the Captain.
5060	The destruction caused by the Metin Stones is[ENTER]becoming worse. The country is suffering. The[ENTER]Metin Stones must be destroyed! Go to the[ENTER]Captain.
5061	I heard that you have worked very hard. People[ENTER]have been talking about your good work. You owe[ENTER]me something for sending you to the right place.[ENTER]Ha, ha! Don't get annoyed, I was only joking![ENTER]You've been doing your job really well.[ENTER][ENTER]But more and more Metin Stones are appearing.[ENTER]It's a serious problem.
5062	If the number of Metin Stones increases, people[ENTER]suffer. I sometimes wonder the Shamans are right[ENTER]and the evil God Sung Mahi has really been[ENTER]resurrected... But first we have to take care of[ENTER]the obvious. Let me know when you've destroyed a[ENTER]Metin Stone!
5063	Task:
5064	The kind of Metin Stone you have to destroy is[ENTER]called Metin of Black. Find it!
5065	Recently more and more falling Metin Stones have[ENTER]been sighted. Their evil radiation has to be[ENTER]stopped! Destroy a Metin of Black.
5066	You have destroyed the Metin of Black. Return to[ENTER]the Captain.
5068	Greetings. Did the City Guard send you? I have an[ENTER]easy mission for you. My father left an important[ENTER]book here this morning. He needs it desperately.
5067	I've completed the first assignment.
5069	Could you take this book to my father? I would do[ENTER]it myself, but I cannot leave the store[ENTER]unattended. If you do me this favour and take[ENTER]this book to him, he will give you a good reward.[ENTER]You should know that he sells armour in the[ENTER]village.
5070	Manufacturing armour
5071	Find the Armour Shop Dealer
5072	Deliver the book
5073	Deliver the book that the General Store[ENTER]Saleswoman's father left behind to him. He is the[ENTER]Armour Shop Dealer from the village.
5074	Armour Shop Dealer:
5075	You look like a man on a mission! Ah, my daughter[ENTER]sent you! Thank you. I need this book to produce[ENTER]new sets of armour.
5076	My daughter must be very busy if she's sending[ENTER]you to give me the book. Let's see, what would be[ENTER]an appropriate reward...?
5077	As a reward, I'm going to give you some Yang, so[ENTER]you can buy yourself some proper equipment. That[ENTER]should be enough, shouldn't it? Thank you. When I[ENTER]need some help again I'll probably ask you for[ENTER]another favour. And when you need a new armour[ENTER]then come and see me. My shop is always open.
5079	You have received 850 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 5,000 Yang.[ENTER]You have received 20 Blue Potions.
5078	It looks like you had fun doing your first task.[ENTER]You're already waiting for the next one? Look for[ENTER]me when you've reached the next level. Then I'll[ENTER]give you another job.
5080	News from the City Guard
5081	Stop hunting and go to the City Guard. He has[ENTER]some more assignments for you.
5082	I'm glad you came around. You probably know the[ENTER]General Store Saleswoman, right? She has asked me[ENTER]for some help. Could you find out what she needs?[ENTER]I hope it's nothing serious, but I'm sure that[ENTER]you can help her.
5083	For your information: The General Store sells[ENTER]regeneration potions and other items which could[ENTER]come in handy in the future. So it would do no[ENTER]harm to get on her right side! Now go.
5084	Find the General Store Saleswoman
5085	Help the General Store Saleswoman
5086	Go to the General Store; the saleswoman needs[ENTER]your help.
5088	There are inscriptions on the Stone Memorial. You[ENTER]quickly make a copy.
5087	Find Uriel
5089	Uriel is right: there really was an inscription[ENTER]on the Stone Memorial. You couldn't read it but[ENTER]at least make a copy. Take your notes to Uriel.
5090	Did you find the Hasun Stone Memorial? Oh, you[ENTER]even have a copy. Very good! That is a a unique[ENTER]historical discovery! Let's see.[ENTER]Hmm... It really seems to be information about[ENTER]the Metin Stones. Although I can't decipher all[ENTER]of it. This writing is really ancient, some of[ENTER]the letters almost look antique. What are we[ENTER]going to do now?
5091	Ah, I have an idea! Do you know the Valley of[ENTER]Seungryong? There's a mysterious ancient site[ENTER]there. If you find old inscriptions there I might[ENTER]be able to draw conclusions about the missing[ENTER]letters. Go to the Valley of Seungryong and look[ENTER]for the Seul Rong Stone Memorial.
5092	Stone Memorial in the Valley of Seungryong
5093	Uriel the scholar needs more ancient texts to[ENTER]draw conclusions about some of the letters he[ENTER]doesn't know.[ENTER]Go to the Valley of Seungryong and look for the[ENTER]inscriptions on the Seul Rong Stone Memorial.
5094	You have found more inscriptions? Oh! Thanks to[ENTER]you, I'll be able to find out the secret of the[ENTER]Metin Stones soon. My investigations might[ENTER]produce results more quickly than I thought.[ENTER]Thank you, thank you! I'll let you know when I[ENTER]need your help again. And here, please take this[ENTER]reward for your efforts.
5095	The secret of the Metin Stones
5096	Uriel has finally managed to get some information[ENTER]about the secret of the Metin Stones. Go and find[ENTER]Uriel the scholar.
5097	Uriel:
5098	The Captain already sent you to me once. You seem[ENTER]to be very talented. I need to ask you a favour.[ENTER]You know about the Metin Stones, don't you? The[ENTER]Metin Stones came down from the sky. They possess[ENTER]evil energy and are spreading disease and making[ENTER]the animals go wild. We don't know how they got[ENTER]into our world or what they consist of. It makes[ENTER]my research a lot more difficult. However, I[ENTER]recently found out the key to the secret of the[ENTER]Metin Stones.
5099	There is a tablet, a memorial of an ancient[ENTER]kingdom, in a cave in the Easy Monkey Dungeon. I[ENTER]think the information on the tablet is about the[ENTER]secret of the Metin Stones. If you bring me the[ENTER]information, I might be able to find out the[ENTER]secret of the Metin Stones. Please bring me the[ENTER]information from the Hasun Stone Memorial in the[ENTER]Easy Monkey Dungeon!
5100	You have received 1,500,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 20,000 Yang.
5101	Stone Memorial in the Easy Monkey Dungeon
5102	Uriel the scholar thinks he has found a clue[ENTER]which may help him to work out the Metin Stones.[ENTER]Go to the Easy Monkey Dungeon and look for the[ENTER]Hasun Stone Memorial.
5104	Hint: If you ride on a horse, you can get it done[ENTER]more quickly and easily.
5103	The secret book
5105	The pages of the secret book
5106	Peddler:
5107	Ever since all these problems started in the[ENTER]world, trade has got really difficult. What do[ENTER]you want to buy? Oh, you were sent from Uriel the[ENTER]scholar? He's a regular customer here, he's[ENTER]always looking for ancient books from different[ENTER]places. It's a bit of a nuisance really. Ha, ha,[ENTER]ha. You want to know more about ancient books?[ENTER]Hm, ancient books...
5108	I heard something a few days ago, but I can't[ENTER]pass it on for free! If you scratch my back, I'll[ENTER]scratch yours, eh? Weapon trade has been going[ENTER]really well recently, but unfortunately I just[ENTER]can't supply such huge amounts! I've been snowed[ENTER]under with orders! As you're just standing around[ENTER]doing nothing, why don't you do something useful[ENTER]for a change and get hold of 20 Silver Swords+0[ENTER]for me? As soon as you bring them to me, I will[ENTER]give you the information that you want.
5109	Find the Peddler
5110	You have 20 Silver Swords+0
5111	The Peddler has heard about the old pages. Give[ENTER]him 20 Silver Swords+0, then he will tell you[ENTER]what he knows.
5112	Get 20 Silver Swords+0
5113	The Peddler has heard about the old pages but[ENTER]didn't want to share the information for free.[ENTER]Get 20 Silver Swords+0 and take them to the[ENTER]Peddler in return for the information.
5115	I have got the swords.
5114	Look for Uriel the scholar
5116	Good. You are more talented than I thought.[ENTER]Thanks to your help, business is going be much[ENTER]better soon. As far as your page is concerned...[ENTER]A few days ago I was passing a pavilion and a[ENTER]memorial next to it. I had a rest there and[ENTER]noticed a torn piece of paper at the foot of the[ENTER]memorial.
5117	At the time I didn't think anything of it. But[ENTER]now I think it could have been one of the old[ENTER]pages you are looking for. The name of the[ENTER]memorial, hmmm... Was it the Weol Memorial? Yes,[ENTER]that's what it's called. The Weol Memorial near[ENTER]the Neighbouring Village. You should look there!
5118	Peddler:
5119	Bring me the 20 Silver Swords+0, and I will give[ENTER]you the information about the old pages.
5120	Looking for the first page
5121	A memorial next to the pavilion
5122	The Peddler has seen an old page at the foot of[ENTER]the Weol Memorial when he had a rest in the[ENTER]pavilion next to the memorial.[ENTER]Go to the Weol Memorial near the First Village[ENTER]and see whether it really is the page you are[ENTER]looking for.
5123	The Weol Memorial
5124	That's the memorial. Ah, there it is! I have the[ENTER]page!
5126	The first page
5125	Uriel the scholar sends for you. He needs help[ENTER]with his research on an old, secret book Go to[ENTER]Uriel and see what you can do for him.
5127	Look for Uriel the scholar
5128	You have found the first page
5129	You have been following the Peddler's clues and[ENTER]have found the first of the missing pages. Take[ENTER]it to Uriel the scholar.
5130	So, did you find the old page? Oh, you have it,[ENTER]great! Let's see what's written on it.[ENTER]Hm... It looks like a diary. Listen
5131	First page of the book:
5132	Lee Seop from the Taejo kingdom is expanding his[ENTER]territory through conquest. He wants to conquer[ENTER]every country using his military forces. We need[ENTER]to ensure he does not take our country. Our[ENTER]options are limited as his army is so large and[ENTER]so strong. That's why we have decided to use the[ENTER]forbidden witchcraft!
5133	First page of the book continued:
5134	This is our only chance of survival. We don't[ENTER]know if it'll be a success, but we should[ENTER]definitely try. Before they attack us, we need to[ENTER]get the information about the forbidden black[ENTER]witchcraft. According to the legend, we should be[ENTER]able to find out about it from the Dragon Valley.
5135	From the contents I can see that ancient beliefs[ENTER]existed in this country. Before Lee Seop from the[ENTER]Taejo kingdom united all the countries, every[ENTER]country had its own special characteristics. As[ENTER]far as I know, every country even had its own[ENTER]religious beliefs. The author of this book, seems[ENTER]to have been quite educated. He probably belonged[ENTER]to one of the guilds or may have even been their[ENTER]captain. Guild members were considered the elite[ENTER]of society.
5137	A lot of talk has been going around about the old[ENTER]stories of the Dragon Valley. I also know a few[ENTER]tales about it. Perhaps we might even still be[ENTER]able to find information about it or find more[ENTER]pages from the book. Unfortunately I have never[ENTER]found out information about where this valley is.[ENTER]Go to the hunter Yang-Shin in the neighbouring[ENTER]village, he knows his way around there really[ENTER]well. He might know where the Dragon Valley is[ENTER]and if there is anything useful to be found[ENTER]there.
5136	Greetings.[ENTER]Your work the last time was very helpful. With[ENTER]your help, I was able to make some real progress.[ENTER]But now I have a problem. While investigating[ENTER]some information about the meteors, I found an[ENTER]old book. As far as I can understand, there are[ENTER]important speculations about the cause of the[ENTER]changes in there, that are affecting our country.[ENTER]It is really important.
5138	How exciting! Oh, before I forget: Here's your[ENTER]reward for your first page!
5139	You have received 1,250,000 experience points.
5140	You have received 50,000 Yang.
5141	You have received a Goddess' Tear.
5142	Go to the hunter
5143	Find the hunter Yang-Shin
5144	Ask Yang-Shin for the Dragon Valley.
5145	On the first page of the secret book the Dragon[ENTER]Valley is mentioned. Uriel has heard stories[ENTER]about it but doesn't know where it is. Go to the[ENTER]Neighbouring Village and ask the hunter Yang-Shin[ENTER]if he knows more about it.
5146	Hint: The hunter is in the Neighbouring Village.
5148	Information about the Dragon Valley
5147	The problem is that the book is very old and[ENTER]ripped. The book was passed on from hand to hand[ENTER]for years, which is probably why it's so badly[ENTER]damaged. 13 pages are missing from this book.[ENTER]Could you get hold of them for me? There is[ENTER]probably some important information on how to end[ENTER]the war on those pages.
5149	Yang-Shin:
5150	You want to know where the Dragon Valley is? That[ENTER]is the very old name for the Valley of[ENTER]Seungryong. There aren't any dragons there, but[ENTER]there are a large amount of orcs and even a[ENTER]secret sect living there instead. Why do you want[ENTER]to go to such a dangerous place? Even I, a clever[ENTER]hunter, don't like going there. It would be[ENTER]better if you kept away from there.
5151	What? You are looking for the old book pages? Hm![ENTER]Once I heard from the hunters that the Orc[ENTER]Sorcerers have got some papers. I wonder whether[ENTER]that's true?[ENTER]If you are so curious, then go figure it out.[ENTER]I already said that it is a dangerous place.[ENTER]Take good care of yourself!
5152	Looking for the second page
5153	As the hunter already mentioned, you should be[ENTER]able to find the Elite Orc Sorcerers in the[ENTER]Dragon Valley. They should have the second old[ENTER]page. Kill the Elite Orc Sorcerers and get hold[ENTER]of the second page. Once you have the page,[ENTER]deliver it to Uriel.
5154	The second page
5155	Found the second page
5156	Hunting the Elite Orc Sorcerer has been[ENTER]successful: you have found the second page of the[ENTER]Secret Book. Take it to Uriel the scholar.
5157	Is that the second page? Let me see. Hmm, it's[ENTER]not very easy to decipher. It[ENTER]says: 
5159	Second page:
5158	Once you find one of the old pages, bring it to[ENTER]me. Then I will try to decipher it. Hmm... Where[ENTER]could you start looking? Some time ago, a Peddler[ENTER]in the neighbouring village told me that he found[ENTER]an old book page. Go to him and see what you can[ENTER]find out.
5160	The dark magic followers have been found.[ENTER]They were hidden in the Dragon Valley. They are[ENTER]very informed about the witchcraft that has been[ENTER]passed through the ages. It took a lot of[ENTER]convincing, some threats and some flattery until[ENTER]they agreed to help us. And the result was: You[ENTER]need a special place to perform forbidden[ENTER]witchcraft. The place has to be full of evil[ENTER]energy. Time is running out so I need to find a[ENTER]suitable place as quickly as possible.
5161	Hm, we need a place full of negative energy for[ENTER]black witchcraft. A place where everything can be[ENTER]converted into evil energy. Hmm... Where can we[ENTER]find a place like that? Hm... Hm... I know, it[ENTER]could be the Hwang Temple! The people don't call[ENTER]it the Temple of Darkness for nothing. It's a[ENTER]place where nobody good hearted wants to go. Even[ENTER]animals don't want to go there. And the secret[ENTER]sect is up to no good there.
5162	Furthermore, there is a connection between the[ENTER]forbidden witchcraft and this secret sect. You[ENTER]can find the key to that in the Hwang Temple.[ENTER]Find out what's going on in the Hwang Temple and[ENTER]see if you can find more book pages there![ENTER]Here is your reward for the second page...
5163	You have received 1,250,000 experience points.
5164	You have received 50,000 Yang.
5165	You have received 10 White Flags.
5166	The third page
5167	You have taken the first two pages of the Secret[ENTER]Book to Uriel. The next page can be found in the[ENTER]Hwang Temple.
5168	Hint: This series of quests will be continued[ENTER]when you have reached level 40.
5169	Go to the Peddler
5170	Look for the pages of the secret book.
5171	Uriel the scholar said that he had heard[ENTER]something about a Peddler with an old book page.[ENTER]Go to the Peddler and ask him about it. You will[ENTER]find him in the second village.
5173	You have received 2,000,000 experience points.
5172	The Temple of Darkness
5174	You have received 50,000 Yang.
5175	You have received the Blessing of Life.
5176	Off into the Yongbi Desert
5177	The search for the memorial
5178	The search for the Wha Memorial
5179	The search for the fourth page
5180	Uriel the scholar thinks that another page can be[ENTER]found in the monkey dungeon Jungsun Dong in the[ENTER]Yongbi Desert. There are two memorials there.[ENTER]Perhaps the fourth page is hidden in one of them[ENTER]too. Go to the Yongbi Desert and look for the[ENTER]memorials in the Jungsun Dong.
5181	That is the Wha Memorial!
5182	But there is no old diary page to be seen.[ENTER]I have to get on and look for another memorial.
5184	The search for the Su Memorial
5183	Uriel the scholar is looking for old diary pages.[ENTER]You have already brought him two of them. Now the[ENTER]exciting hunt for the secret of the old book[ENTER]continues.[ENTER]The discoveries so far indicate that the Proud[ENTER]Dark Fanatics that live in the Hwang Temple have[ENTER]the next page.[ENTER]Be on your way!
5185	This must be it! The Su Memorial.
5186	But there is no old diary page to be seen.[ENTER]I have to get on and find another memorial.
5187	The fourth page
5188	Found the fourth page
5189	The ancient memorials prove to be faithful[ENTER]guardians of their treasures: you have found the[ENTER]fourth old page in Jungsun Dong. Take it to Uriel[ENTER]the scholar.
5190	The fourth old page
5191	Oh! You have found the fourth old page.[ENTER]Hopefully, we will get some new insights with the[ENTER]new information we have received from the book.
5192	Fourth page:
5193	Now I'm in the deep cave where the monkeys live.[ENTER]My companions are petrified, but the bad energy[ENTER]we have gathered here is still insufficient. Time[ENTER]is going by too fast and Lee Seop's cavalry is[ENTER]coming closer and closer. I wonder whether we'll[ENTER]make it on time?
5195	Fourth page continued:
5194	Found the third page
5196	I need to find the next location as soon as[ENTER]possible. Nothing is lost yet. I'll try the[ENTER]Spider Caves. This time, our wish might even come[ENTER]true...
5197	Hm. The monkey dungeon is not the place we are[ENTER]looking for. So let's try again! According to[ENTER]what it says here, we need to go to the Spider[ENTER]Caves. But first we have to tend to a more urgent[ENTER]affair: The Captain is very worried because a lot[ENTER]of strangers have been hanging around near the[ENTER]village and asking strange questions. You should[ENTER]go see him and find out what's going on there.
5198	This whole situation is making me uneasy. Let's[ENTER]see what the Captain says. Oh, before I forget:[ENTER]Here's your reward for the fourth page.
5199	You have received 2,000,000 experience points.
5200	You have also got a Blessing of Magic.
5201	The eerie strangers
5202	Go to the Captain
5203	Ask the Captain about the strangers
5204	Rumour has it that a lot of strangers have been[ENTER]appearing in the village. They are asking a[ENTER]suspicious amount of questions about the[ENTER]memorials. The Captain wants to do something[ENTER]about it. Go see him and find out more.
5206	The strangers in the village
5205	Uriel the scholar's assumptions about the Proud[ENTER]Dark Fanatics were correct. You have found the[ENTER]third diary page in their possession. Take the[ENTER]page to Uriel the scholar.
5207	There has been an increasing number of strangers[ENTER]coming into our village. They keep asking about[ENTER]memorials and ancient books. Some people know[ENTER]about it, but they do not want to tell the[ENTER]strangers. I'm afraid that it might get us all[ENTER]into trouble. No one knows who sent these[ENTER]strangers and how far they might go to get their[ENTER]information. After all, we're at war.
5208	If my sources are correct, Nakajima from the[ENTER]neighbouring village has something to do with it.[ENTER]Please try and find out from him what the[ENTER]strangers want here.
5209	Go to Nakajima
5210	The Captain thinks there is a connection between[ENTER]Nakajima and the strangers who are asking[ENTER]everywhere in the village for the memorials. Go[ENTER]to Nakajima and find out what he knows. You'll[ENTER]find him on the outskirts of the second village.
5211	You know the strangers in the village?
5212	Nakajima:
5213	Excuse me? What kind of question is that? I'm[ENTER]sorry. I can't help you. I don't have the[ENTER]slightest clue about what you're talking about.[ENTER]No, no. It's hard enough to find work at the[ENTER]moment as it is. What am I supposed to live on,[ENTER]eh?
5214	Oh well, I admit to it. But I only agreed because[ENTER]they promised me a lot of Yang.[ENTER]I don't know what the strangers wanted here. But[ENTER]they have given me a mission: I'm supposed to[ENTER]kill the Bestial Captains.
5215	You could probably find out more from the Bestial[ENTER]Captains. The strangers really wanted me to kill[ENTER]him. Oh, I've got an idea: Why don't you go and[ENTER]kill him for me? Please?
5217	Kill the Bestial Captains
5216	Oh, you've found the next clue?! It's the third[ENTER]page. Let's see what it says.
5218	Nakajima has confessed that the strangers want to[ENTER]kill the Bestial Captains. As the strangers have[ENTER]been asking about the Diary Pages, the Bestial[ENTER]Captains obviously have a page with them To find[ENTER]out more, I have to kill the Bestial Captains.[ENTER]They can be found outside the second village.
5219	You have found the fifth page
5220	I got there before the strangers and took the[ENTER]fifth diary page from the Bestial Captains. I'm[ENTER]sure the strangers will disappear now that[ENTER]there's nothing left for them to find here. I'd[ENTER]best take this page to the scholar Uriel so that[ENTER]I can decipher it.
5221	The fifth page
5222	Note: You can only take the fifth page to Uriel[ENTER]once you have reached level 47. Take good care of[ENTER]the page until then!
5223	You have received 750,000 experience points.
5224	Third page:
5225	We have found a place that is ruled by evil[ENTER]energy. But that's not enough. That place is[ENTER]evil, but it's not appropriate for practising[ENTER]magic, which is a real blow. But our spies are[ENTER]talking about a hidden place in the desert that[ENTER]could be promising for us. We're going to head[ENTER]there now and are very optimistic.
5226	So, they were unable to achieve their goal at the[ENTER]Dragon Valley. Hm... The Yongbi Desert? You don't[ENTER]usually meet many people there and the area is[ENTER]largely unexplored. But this is all very[ENTER]complicated. Where exactly is this area that[ENTER]they're talking about? I presume that they mean[ENTER]the Monkey Dungeon Jungsun Dong. It is a deep[ENTER]cave that is very well equipped for gathering bad[ENTER]energy.
5227	Please go to the Jungsun Dong and look for more[ENTER]stone memorials. With a bit of luck you can find[ENTER]more pages near the memorials. Oh, and of course[ENTER]we shouldn't forget your reward for the third[ENTER]page.
5229	The page in the Spider Dungeon
5228	The page from the Bestial Captains
5230	Uriel thinks that further information about black[ENTER]witchcraft can be found in the Spider Dungeon.[ENTER]Maybe we'll find a monument like the one in the[ENTER]Monkey Dungeon there too.[ENTER][ENTER]You can get to the Spider Dungeon via the Yongbi[ENTER]Desert.
5231	The Mok Memorial
5232	Really! Here is a memorial and also a Diary Page.[ENTER]Quickly go back to Uriel.
5233	Found the sixth page
5234	You have found another ancient memorial in the[ENTER]Spider Dungeon and also the sixth diary page that[ENTER]was hidden there. Deliver it to Uriel the[ENTER]scholar.
5235	The sixth page
5236	How was the Spider Dungeon? Did you find the[ENTER]sixth page? That's fantastic! I was worried that[ENTER]you might be too late. One always hears about[ENTER]other people who are also looking for the secrets[ENTER]of black witchcraft. It seems to be very[ENTER]important information. Let's see what this page[ENTER]says.
5237	Oh no, this page is very difficult to read. I'm[ENTER]going to need longer than usual to decipher it.[ENTER]But the content looks very important. This symbol[ENTER]means 'Black Witchcraft', so we're definitely on[ENTER]the right track. I would like to know why black[ENTER]witchcraft has been banned. There's probably a[ENTER]good reason for it.
5238	While I'm trying to decipher this page, you[ENTER]should go to the musician Yu-Hwan. I heard that[ENTER]he has some interesting information for our[ENTER]search. When you get back, I will be able to tell[ENTER]you what this page says. But of course you will[ENTER]get your reward now.
5240	You have received 3,000,000 experience points.
5239	At level 40, you managed to get the fifth page of[ENTER]the secret diary from the Bestial Captains. Now[ENTER]take it to Uriel.
5241	You have received 75,000 Yang.
5242	You have received a Blessing of the Dragon.
5243	Go to Yu-Hwan
5244	Find the musician Yu-Hwan
5245	The secret forces
5246	The musician Yu-Hwan may have some information[ENTER]about the old diary pages. Go and see him and ask[ENTER]him about it.
5247	Any news?
5248	Enjoy life, because it is very short![ENTER]Trallalaaa... Ah, there you are again. You've[ENTER]probably just come from Uriel the scholar. He[ENTER]asked whether I could ask around a bit. I've[ENTER]found out that in all kingdoms people have been[ENTER]going around looking for important documents.[ENTER]Unfortunately nobody could tell me exactly what[ENTER]it's all about.
5249	It's a bit weird that these strange creeping[ENTER]figures are hanging around while we're in the[ENTER]middle of a war. You excluded, of course! I also[ENTER]heard that the Desert Outlaws were able to loot[ENTER]some things that could be quite important for us.[ENTER]Perhaps you should try having a look at what you[ENTER]can get out of them.
5251	The Desert Outlaws are quite dangerous beasts, so[ENTER]watch out. But I think it'll be worth it. I'm[ENTER]going to dedicate a song to you and entrust the[ENTER]wind with it, so that it follows you into the[ENTER]desert.
5250	The fifth page
5252	The Desert Outlaws
5253	The quest for the secret information
5254	Uriel needs all information about black[ENTER]witchcraft. Yu-Hwan, the musician, said that the[ENTER]Desert Outlaws stole something that could have[ENTER]helped us out. I should leave now and kill a[ENTER]couple of Desert Outlaws.
5255	Found the seventh page
5256	Looking for the musician Yu-Hwan
5257	Thanks to the information that the musician[ENTER]Yu-Hwan gave you, you were able to find the[ENTER]seventh page of the secret book at the Desert[ENTER]Outlaws'. Go to Yu-Hwan and tell him that his[ENTER]information was correct.
5258	Your eyes are as beautiful as a mountain lake[ENTER]lalalala.... Hey, there you are again. Were you[ENTER]successful in regard to the desert bandits? What,[ENTER]that's all? An old piece of paper? That's no use[ENTER]to me. But if it makes you happy... Take it to[ENTER]Uriel. And send him my best wishes!
5259	Go to Uriel
5260	Go to Uriel
5262	The seventh page
5261	You've got the fifth page? Unbelievable. We're[ENTER]really lucky that these pages even exist after[ENTER]all these years. You really are very proficient.[ENTER]Now let's see what this page says.
5263	You have found the seventh page of the old diary.[ENTER]Take it to Uriel.
5264	Hello, nice to see you again! I have good news: I[ENTER]have finished deciphering the sixth page. Not[ENTER]bad, eh? I have to admit, I am quite proud of[ENTER]myself. Because what actually caught my eye, was[ENTER]that this character... Excuse me? You found[ENTER]another one? My goodness! That was really fast.[ENTER]Show me. Wow, where did you get that one from? If[ENTER]I'm not mistaken, these are the characters that[ENTER]were used by the imperial family.
5265	Since these characters were rarely used and then[ENTER]only by very few people, it is very difficult to[ENTER]translate them. But I guess a bit of a challenge[ENTER]never harmed anyone, haha! I'm looking forward to[ENTER]it. The Desert Outlaws stole this page from the[ENTER]mysterious strangers? Hmm...[ENTER]Does this mean that the strangers understand[ENTER]these characters? This is getting so confusing.[ENTER]We need to make sure that we don't overlook[ENTER]anything.
5266	Oh yeah, oversight: Before I concentrate on the[ENTER]next page, I should probably tell you what was on[ENTER]the sixth page. Hrm-hrm...
5267	Sixth page:
5268	Time is running out. Now we've even tried using[ENTER]black witchcraft in the Spider Dungeon and it[ENTER]still didn't work.[ENTER]What are we missing? Some of our mystics think[ENTER]that black witchcraft demands bigger sacrifices.[ENTER]If this is true, then it must be an immensely[ENTER]powerful force.
5269	According to fairy tales and legends, this type[ENTER]of magic always demands human sacrifice. But if I[ENTER]kill their loved ones at the altar, my reputation[ENTER]amongst the people will receive a knocking. We[ENTER]need an adequate substitute. Let's try it with[ENTER]the Snake Swordsmen from the desert.
5270	Aha. So because they couldn't sacrifice humans,[ENTER]they decided to use snake fighters. I can't[ENTER]pretend that I like this new development. It's[ENTER]going to end badly... We still need to follow[ENTER]their trail though. Go to the desert and kill[ENTER]some Snake Swordsmen and Snake Archers there. Who[ENTER]knows what else we might find there. By t he way:[ENTER]your reward is in this purse!
5271	Kill the snake fighters
5273	The eighth page
5272	Fifth page:
5274	The diary describes the attempt to sacrifice[ENTER]Snake Swordsman and Snake Archers for carrying[ENTER]out black witchcraft. Go to the Yongbi Desert and[ENTER]kill Snake Swordsmen. Look out for some more[ENTER]information.
5275	Found the eighth page
5276	Go to Uriel the scholar
5277	You have found the eighth page of the diary with[ENTER]the Snake Swordmen in the Desert. Take it to[ENTER]Uriel the scholar.
5278	That's the eighth page. Very good. Since it is[ENTER]very short, I think I can read it out straight[ENTER]away. One moment please...Ah, yes.
5279	Eighth page:
5280	The necessary victims have been found. We're[ENTER]lucky. I wonder whether that's a sign? We need a[ENTER]ceremonial bell. If I remember rightly the[ENTER]spiders have something like that . We'll set off[ENTER]now.
5281	Ah, the Spider Dungeon again, strange. You have[ENTER]to go there and look for the bell. It's going to[ENTER]be an exhausting journey, so relax a bit first[ENTER]and come back later. I'm going have a bit of a[ENTER]think and translate some more fragments. When you[ENTER]come back, I'll give you a new mission. And don't[ENTER]worry, of course you'll get your reward for the[ENTER]eighth page now.
5282	Experience points: 3,000,000[ENTER]Yang: 70,000[ENTER]Bravery Capes: 20[ENTER]Note: For the next assignment, you need to have a[ENTER]minimum level of 50.
5283	Lee Seop has arrived in the Taejo kingdom with[ENTER]his cavalry but seems to want to stay there for a[ENTER]while. In the meantime both small and large[ENTER]meteorites are raining down on the country.[ENTER]They're causing chaos, destruction and conflict.[ENTER]The vast kingdom has split into three smaller[ENTER]kingdoms. They are also fighting amongst each[ENTER]other, instead of fighting evil together. The[ENTER]Dragon God is not talking to us any more either.[ENTER]Sometimes he supports one party and sometimes the[ENTER]other. Thus everyone is fighting for his favour[ENTER]and in the meantime the disaster is just getting[ENTER]worse and worse...
5284	Uriel:
5285	An eyewitness account of our era's early days.[ENTER]It truly is priceless! Oh yeah, pay. Here's a[ENTER]reward for your excellent work. And something[ENTER]else: Someone else is obviously undertaking the[ENTER]same investigations as we are. So we don't have[ENTER]any time to lose.[ENTER]At the bottom this page it says that Lee Seop has[ENTER]been looking for evil energy in the Spider[ENTER]Dungeon. If you find something there, come see me[ENTER]immediately.[ENTER]I can't wait!
5286	The sixth page
5288	Hey, not so fast, hotspur! Don't forget your[ENTER]reward for the ninth page!
5287	Kill Proud Soldier Spiders
5289	You receive 5,000,000 experience points.
5290	You have received 125,000 Yang.
5291	You have received a Sage King's Symbol.
5292	The clue in Ice Land
5293	The Old Box with Papers
5294	Looking for the Old Box with Papers
5295	At Mount Sohan the enemy armies finally stumbled[ENTER]upon each other. Look for further diary pages or[ENTER]other written evidence about the progress of the[ENTER]battle.
5296	An Old Box with Papers!
5297	These are military plans and notes.[ENTER]And here is another diary page![ENTER]I should take it to Uriel.
5299	The tenth page
5298	Our previous research indicates that there are[ENTER]clues in the Spider Dungeon. Catch the Proud[ENTER]Soldier Spider in Kuahlo Dong. If you find[ENTER]another page from the old book take it to Uriel[ENTER]the scholar.
5300	Found the tenth page
5301	You have found the tenth page of the Secret Diary[ENTER]in Ice Land. It was in an Old Box with Papers.[ENTER]Take it to Uriel.
5302	Ah, you found the missing tenth Diary Page![ENTER]Great, we are getting closer to the end of the[ENTER]story. It's good they documented everything[ENTER]otherwise this knowledge would be lost. Let's see[ENTER]what the page says.
5303	Tenth Page:
5304	We have succeeded in repelling the first attack.[ENTER]But the next one will follow soon. The terrain[ENTER]will handicap Lee Seops heavy iron soldiers and[ENTER]will give us some advantages, but they are just[ENTER]too many. We cannot win. We only have one last[ENTER]chance, finish our black witchcraft research.[ENTER]Under cover of darkness we will penetrate the[ENTER]enemy lines and go back to the Spider Caves. I'm[ENTER]praying. Not for victory, but for a little bit of[ENTER]hope...
5305	Ooohh. I think we are almost there! Soon we will[ENTER]find out what Black Magic is all about. I can't[ENTER]wait! You have to return to the Spider Dungeon[ENTER]once more. Hopefully the eleventh page of the[ENTER]book is there.
5306	And here is - once again - your well earned[ENTER]reward!
5307	You have received 5,500,000 experience points.
5308	You have received 137,500 Yang.
5309	You have received a Sage King's Glove.
5311	Kill Claw Poison Spiders
5310	The ninth page
5312	The black witchcraft research is being continued[ENTER]in the Spider Caves. Go there and kill some Claw[ENTER]Poison Spiders to find out the required[ENTER]information.
5313	The eleventh page
5314	Return to Uriel the scholar
5315	You've found the Eleventh Page
5316	You found the eleventh page of the Secret Diary[ENTER]in the Spider Dungeon. Take it to Uriel.
5317	Have you found out any new information? Aha, the[ENTER]eleventh page! Let's see...[ENTER]Ah yes, it looks quite easy. I've become quite[ENTER]good at reading these characters now. Now, watch[ENTER]this!
5318	Eleventh Page:
5319	It has failed. Despite all our preparation, we[ENTER]had to act fast. Too fast. Now a lot of us are[ENTER]injured, and some of us have even gone insane.[ENTER]Black witchcraft truly is evil. Lee Seop's[ENTER]cavalry are onto us, but that's irrelevant now.[ENTER]We don't have enough men to defend ourselves[ENTER]against him and we're going to die anyway.
5320	Continuation of the Eleventh Page:
5321	One last thought is keeping the rest of the troop[ENTER]together and is giving us strength: Our[ENTER]informants in the Dragon Valley lied. They[ENTER]deliberately didn't warn us ways from the[ENTER]terrible side effects of black witchcraft.[ENTER]They'll pay for doing that. It will be our last[ENTER]deed on this earth.
5322	Well, in the end it turned out a little bit[ENTER]differently than they were hoping. A sad story.[ENTER]But unfortunately you can't trust anyone who is[ENTER]involved with black witchcraft. They should have[ENTER]thought of that. It's strange enough that the[ENTER]author of these lines even managed to receive[ENTER]information about these forbidden schemes. Who[ENTER]knows what kind of goal his informants had. We[ENTER]should finish this path though, even if it's[ENTER]dangerous. We already know so much, it would be a[ENTER]shame to give up now.
5323	You have already been to the Valley of[ENTER]Seungryong. I don't think we'll find anything[ENTER]else there. Hmm, I wonder where else we can[ENTER]look... I know! The memorials played a big part[ENTER]during our search. And there are also memorials[ENTER]around that we haven't investigated yet. The ones[ENTER]in the other kingdoms! It's very dangerous there.[ENTER]You will probably be attacked constantly.[ENTER]So prepare yourself well and come see me when[ENTER]you're ready.
5325	But first, I will give you your reward for the[ENTER]eleventh page.
5324	Go to Uriel the scholar
5326	You have received 6,000,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 150,000 Yang.[ENTER]You have received a Medal of the Dragon.[ENTER]Hint: For the next assignment, you need to be at[ENTER]least on level 55.
5327	Found the ninth page
5328	You have found the ninth page in the Spider[ENTER]Dungeon. Take it to Uriel the scholar.
5329	You found out something else about black[ENTER]witchcraft? Wow, the ninth page! I'm really[ENTER]excited to see whether the magic worked or not.[ENTER]Let's have a look. Hmm, it says here...
5330	Ninth Page:
5331	Lee Seop's attack has begun. And we still don't[ENTER]know exactly how to use black witchcraft. I'm[ENTER]really nervous. We are at the front-line, trying[ENTER]to defend our kingdom, but our strength is[ENTER]insufficient. The enemy army is much too strong[ENTER]and if something doesn't happen soon, we're going[ENTER]to lose the battle. We need to retreat. It would[ENTER]be best for us to retreat to a barren place,[ENTER]where they won't be able to use their horses[ENTER]properly: The Ice Desert. With a bit of luck[ENTER]we'll then have enough time to keep researching.[ENTER]Oh, God help us...
5332	Hmm... The attack began before they were able to[ENTER]research black witchcraft properly. They have had[ENTER]to barricade themselves in the Ice Desert.[ENTER]They must mean Mount Sohan, which is also called[ENTER]Ice Land nowadays. We should look for some more[ENTER]clues. Go to Mount Sohan and see what you can[ENTER]find out.
5334	You have found the twelfth page in the Joan Area.[ENTER]Take it to Uriel in the Yongan Area.
5333	Looking for the memorials
5335	You have found the twelfth page in the Yongan[ENTER]Area. Take it to Uriel in the Pyungmo Area.
5336	I'm delighted to see you again. I'm sorry that I[ENTER]had to send you here, there and everywhere, but[ENTER]at least our success has proven us right, don't[ENTER]you think? Let's see what it says. I hope it was[ENTER]all worth it.
5337	Twelfth page:
5338	We found the informants and they paid for their[ENTER]deception with their lives. But what is much more[ENTER]important is that we were still able to squeeze[ENTER]some information out of them: We don't need the[ENTER]Spider Caves, but the Temple of Darkness. This is[ENTER]where the ancient belief followers have been[ENTER]performing their dark rituals since the beginning[ENTER]of time.
5339	Continuation of the Twelfth Page:
5340	We've only got one more way of stopping Lee Seop[ENTER]left. We need to travel to the Temple of Darkness[ENTER]so that we can perform black witchcraft. There[ENTER]aren't many of us left and the exertion from the[ENTER]last few months has certainly taken its toll. But[ENTER]even a handful of tired men can change the fate[ENTER]of the world when they have powerful information.[ENTER]We can't lose sight of our goal. Let's go.
5341	Ah, so they did find the right place. I was right[ENTER]after all! It really is the Hwang Temple. You[ENTER]probably remember that dark place, that was[ENTER]buzzing with bad energy. As long as anyone can[ENTER]remember, rituals and ceremonies have been taking[ENTER]place there, from which honest villagers[ENTER]shouldn't should steer clear of.
5342	Nowadays monsters are the only things living in[ENTER]the temple, there haven't been humans there for a[ENTER]long time. It's very dangerous, but I'm sure that[ENTER]you can make it. Go to the Valley of Seungryong[ENTER]and look for the last page in the Hwang Temple.[ENTER]The story that this diary has been telling us[ENTER]finished there. I need to find out how it[ENTER]finished. Good luck! Oh, wait a second, here's[ENTER]your reward for the twelfth page.
5343	You have received 7,500,000 experience points.
5344	You have received 162,500 Yang.
5346	The last page
5345	As you have already found several Diary Pages[ENTER]near the memorials, Uriel thinks that you will be[ENTER]able to find out more information about the[ENTER]secret dark witchcraft near the unexplored[ENTER]memorials. Go to the Chunjo Kingdom and[ENTER]investigate the memorial in the Joan Area.
5347	Kill Bogeymen in the Temple
5348	So far, you've found 12 of the 13 Diary Pages.[ENTER]Now, there's only one more step left. Uriel says[ENTER]that black magic has been cast at the Hwang[ENTER]Temple. You should go there and find out some[ENTER]more information. Start your search by killing[ENTER]the Bogeymen in the temple.
5349	I have to go deeper into the Temple!
5350	The Temple of Darkness
5351	The evil energy of the temple
5352	After you have spent a bit of time in the temple,[ENTER]you develop a feeling for this strange, dark[ENTER]place: Slow shadows flicker in every corner. Dark[ENTER]energy seeps out of every crack and nook like[ENTER]oil. It is obvious that the temple itself is the[ENTER]reason behind it. This is where it all began...
5353	You become aware of the fact that the wickedness[ENTER]that lies in the air gets stronger, the further[ENTER]you move towards the centre of the temple. You[ENTER]should try finding the middle of the temple.[ENTER]That's where the source of the darkness must be.
5354	The Gum Memorial
5355	The Gum Memorial is at the heart of the temple.[ENTER]You slowly move closer and actually find the last[ENTER]Diary Page.
5357	You found the last page of the Secret Diary in[ENTER]the Temple of Darkness. Go to Uriel and report[ENTER]back to him about your discovery.
5356	As you have already found several Diary Pages[ENTER]near the memorials, Uriel thinks that more[ENTER]information about the secret black witchcraft can[ENTER]be found near and around the unexplored[ENTER]memorials. Go to the Jinno Kingdom and explore[ENTER]the memorial in the Pyungmo Area.
5358	There it is, the thirteenth and final page! I[ENTER]can't tell you how grateful I am to you for doing[ENTER]this. Look at my how my hands are shaking.[ENTER]I'm too excited to even read the page. Phew...[ENTER]Ah well, let's see how the story ends.
5359	Thirteenth Page:
5360	We've finally arrived.[ENTER]After all our ordeals we now have the following[ENTER]mission: We need to perform the ceremony and[ENTER]activate the black witchcraft magic. I just hope[ENTER]we're strong enough. A lot of us are swaying[ENTER]slightly, because we're so exhausted from the[ENTER]long journey and from constantly being on the run[ENTER]from Lee Seop's warriors. However we still have[ENTER]to try or our kingdom will perish.
5361	Continuation of the Thirteenth Page:
5362	There are seven of us. We did put on our best[ENTER]clothing, even if they do look like rags now. We[ENTER]are going to gather in a circle and hold hands so[ENTER]that the lines of power are sealed. Then we will[ENTER]start singing the magic words and hope that the[ENTER]black witchcraft does not make any more[ENTER]sacrifices.[ENTER]...
5363	... It's over...[ENTER]At the beginning it was all very promising. The[ENTER]room filled up with energy and song, but suddenly[ENTER]I felt really strange. My six fellow combatants[ENTER]fell to their knees. The temple began to quake.[ENTER]Then lightning struck and we were hurtled[ENTER]backwards. And then the lines of power broke...[ENTER]Now it is quiet. My comrades are lying dead on[ENTER]the ground. The magic didn't work.[ENTER]We have failed.
5364	What? Is that all?!?[ENTER]That's crazy! All that work for nothing? I can't[ENTER]believe it. We travelled, fought, translated and[ENTER]mulled it over for hours. All for nothing! We're[ENTER]just as wise to it as we were before. However it[ENTER]does seem to be better if we keep away from black[ENTER]witchcraft, which is what I had thought from the[ENTER]beginning. But knowing is better than believing,[ENTER]isn't it?
5365	We're going to take a break first. I have a[ENTER]headache and you're probably quite worn out too.[ENTER]I need to run it though my head first. When I'm[ENTER]finished, we'll talk further. Despite everything,[ENTER]you provided me with an invaluable service. It[ENTER]will not go unrewarded!
5366	You have received 9,000,000 experience points.
5367	You have received 175,000 Yang.
5369	You obtain a Book of the Leader.
5368	As you have already found several Diary Pages[ENTER]near the memorials, Uriel thinks that you will be[ENTER]able to find out more information about the[ENTER]secret dark witchcraft near the unexplored[ENTER]memorials. Go to the Shinsoo Kingdom and[ENTER]investigate the memorial in the Yongan Area.
5370	You have received 5,500,000 experience points.
5371	There it is!
5372	This is the monument that Uriel was looking for.[ENTER]There is a folded page too! I should quickly take[ENTER]it to Uriel.
5373	Found the twelfth page
5374	Return to Uriel
5375	You have found the twelfth page in the Pyungmo[ENTER]Area. Take it to Uriel in the Joan Area.
5377	Go to the Blacksmith. He needs your help.
5376	Go to the City Guard
5378	Who are you and what do you want here?[ENTER]I'm verybusy so don't disturb me.[ENTER]Oh the city Guard sent you? I thought nobody[ENTER]would ever come. It's not a difficult task and it[ENTER]won't take long. Just the right thing for a young[ENTER]adventurer like you.
5379	I'm supposed to be getting a delivery from the[ENTER]Storekeeper - I really need a Pig Nose. I've been[ENTER]waiting for ages. Could you help me out and get[ENTER]hold of one for me? It's really important.
5380	Ask the Storekeeper
5381	Go to the Storekeeper
5382	The blacksmith is waiting for an urgent delivery[ENTER]from the Storekeeper. Go to the Storekeeper and[ENTER]ask him for a Pig Nose for the blacksmith.
5383	Storekeeper:
5384	Welcome. I'm the Storekeeper of this village. If[ENTER]you have too much stuff with you, some of it can[ENTER]be stored at my storehouse.
5385	Do you want to... Ah, the blacksmith sent you for[ENTER]Pig Nose!
5386	I'm afraid I'm getting old and forgetful. In the[ENTER]past something like that would not have happened.[ENTER]Here's the Pig Nose. Please take it immediately[ENTER]to the Blacksmith. See you later.
5388	Return to the Blacksmith
5387	The City Guard has a new mission for you.[ENTER]Go to him and ask him what it is all about.
5389	The Storekeeper has completely forgotten the[ENTER]delivery. He has now given you the Pig's Nose.[ENTER]Quickly take it to the blacksmith so he doesn't[ENTER]have to wait any longer.
5390	You came back more quickly than I thought! You[ENTER]should keep up this speed, it could be useful in[ENTER]the future. And now listen carefully, I have some[ENTER]important information for you.
5391	Do you know anything about refinement? Of course[ENTER]not! You're still a young adventurer! It's about[ENTER]this: If you give me a piece of your equipment, I[ENTER]can work on it for only a few Yang so that its[ENTER]attributes will improve.
5392	The art of refinement can occur in several[ENTER]different ways - the higher your aspired aim, the[ENTER]harder the execution. For an improvement of +3 or[ENTER]below you just need a bit of Yang and for[ENTER]everything else an additional item is needed.[ENTER]Like for instance, the Pig Nose your brought me.[ENTER]However, sometimes the item that you would like[ENTER]to refine is destroyed even if the process is[ENTER]done by a skilled blacksmith like me.[ENTER]Come around if you have some time. I can forge[ENTER]fantastic weapons!
5393	You have received %s experience points.
5394	You have received %s Yang.
5395	You have received some Wolf Fur+.
5396	Hey, you there! Now is not the time to hang[ENTER]around and do nothing. You need to do some hard[ENTER]training! Training is the only way to increase[ENTER]your chances of survival in these times!
5397	But as you are here anyway I have a mission for[ENTER]you: the Blacksmith was here a short while ago[ENTER]and said something about pigs and delivery[ENTER]problems. Perhaps he needs help. Go to him and[ENTER]tell him I have sent you. Off you go!
5398	If you fulfil the mission for the Blacksmith you[ENTER]will get a reward.
5399	Experience points: %s
5400	Yang: %s 
5401	Find the Blacksmith
5402	The Blacksmith's mission
5404	Mount Sohan? I saw an old gravestone there once!
5403	A new clue
5405	You don't perhaps remember any inscription on it?[ENTER]Evidently not. This gravestone may be able to[ENTER]provide us with valuable information on the Dark[ENTER]Nation. Could you perhaps go to Mount Sohan and[ENTER]make a copy of the inscription for me?
5406	According to Uriel's investigations, the seven[ENTER]Dragon Priestesses belonged to the Dark Nation.[ENTER]Examine the old gravestone on Mount Sohan. The[ENTER]capital of the Dark Nation was supposed to be[ENTER]there, once long ago.
5407	You don't perhaps remember any inscription on it?[ENTER]Evidently not. This gravestone may be able to[ENTER]provide us with valuable information on the Dark[ENTER]Nation. Could you perhaps go to Mount Sohan and[ENTER]make a copy of the inscription for me?
5408	You have located the old gravestone from the[ENTER]times of the Dark Nation and made a copy of the[ENTER]inscription. Take it to Uriel.
5409	According to Uriel's investigations, the seven[ENTER]Dragon Priestesses belonged to the Dark Nation.[ENTER]Examine the old gravestone on Mount Sohan. The[ENTER]capital of the Dark Nation was supposed to be[ENTER]there, once long ago.
5410	Finally! Let me analyse the inscription...[ENTER]It says the following: the Dark Nation has[ENTER]dedicated itself to black magic and serves Sung[ENTER]Mahi, God of the Demons.
5411	Oh my... Sung Mahi! Then perhaps the seven Dragon[ENTER]Priestesses attempted to summon Sung Mahi using[ENTER]the power of the forbidden witchcraft?
5412	You've done well. For such efforts, it's only[ENTER]fair you receive a reward.
5413	You have received %d experience points.
5415	You have received %d Yang.
5414	Uriel has found new information on the story from[ENTER]the old diary. Seek Uriel out and find out more.
5416	You have received %s.
5417	Dark Nation II
5418	According to Uriel, the Ghost Forest once was[ENTER]part of the Dark Nation's kingdom. There may[ENTER]perhaps be further clues there.[ENTER]But this forest is full of dangers and the Metin[ENTER]stones have put all the creatures there in a[ENTER]frenzy. Find the Evil Tree in order to receive[ENTER]more evidence. Then speak with Uriel.
5419	The Dark Nation is surrounded by numerous[ENTER]secrets. Thanks to you, we have been able to air[ENTER]some of these, but we are still missing important[ENTER]information. Please head out and hunt for an old[ENTER]document. It should be located in the Ghost[ENTER]Forest near to Mount Sohan.
5420	Pages remaining:
5421	The Dark Nation is surrounded by numerous[ENTER]secrets. Thanks to you, we have been able to air[ENTER]some of these, but we are still missing important[ENTER]information. Please head out and hunt for an old[ENTER]document. It should be located in the Ghost[ENTER]Forest near to Mount Sohan.
5422	You have defeated the Evil Tree and taken the[ENTER]document. It has been written in a foreign[ENTER]language. Allow Uriel to translate it.
5423	Finally! You have found the old document.[ENTER]Hopefully it will shed some light on this matter!
5424	But whaa...? There's hardly anything in it! The[ENTER]document is actually made of ten pages. Please[ENTER]head back into the forest and find the remaining[ENTER]nine pages.
5426	You still need to find %d pages.
5425	How are you? Do you remember that diary and the[ENTER]story in it? The one that abruptly ends on the[ENTER]thirteenth and final page?
5427	So, now we'll see...[ENTER]Apparently the Dark Nation ensnared the High[ENTER]Priestess of the Dragon cult using a curse and[ENTER]misused the holy powers of the seven women in[ENTER]order to carry out the ancient arts of black[ENTER]witchcraft.
5428	To summon Sung Mahi, the black witchcraft must be[ENTER]used at the same time at seven different[ENTER]locations. But Lee Seop and his army managed to[ENTER]stop the ritual in time and foiled the Dark[ENTER]Nation's plans.
5429	This Nation was most definitely to be feared.[ENTER]They were capable of controlling human[ENTER]conciousness through black magic!
5430	The Clue
5431	Uriel has uncovered clues relating to the Gum[ENTER]Memorial in the old scrolls. Go to him to find[ENTER]out more.
5432	Let's summarise what we have learnt so far: Once[ENTER]there was a people, who called themselves the[ENTER]Dark Nation and who served the demon god Sung[ENTER]Mahi. In order to summon him, they ensnared the[ENTER]seven Dragon Priestesses and misused their holy[ENTER]powers for the forbidden arts of black[ENTER]witchcraft. But this needed to be carried out at[ENTER]seven locations all at the same time.
5433	The Dragon Priestesses only carried out the black[ENTER]witchcraft in this one tower and not at the seven[ENTER]different locations...[ENTER]This is why the summoning of Sung Mahi failed!
5434	The Dark Nation must have given the seven Dragon[ENTER]Priestesses the wrong information.
5435	Perhaps they too did not know how to do it...[ENTER]It could be chance, but the old scrolls mention[ENTER]this tower in relation to the Gum Memorial. It[ENTER]seems that they are talking about the Demon Tower[ENTER]at Hwang Temple.
5437	We have finally found the decisive clue on the[ENTER]seven Dragon Priestesses! Calm yourself a little[ENTER]and then we'll talk about what to do next. I fear[ENTER]that a trip to the Demon Tower looms before[ENTER]you...
5436	Yes, naturally. Seven people ran from Lee Seop[ENTER]and his cavalry into the Hwang Temple and in[ENTER]their desperation, they enacted the forbidden[ENTER]black witchcraft... in the end, only one of them[ENTER]survived.
5438	The next part of this adventure is available once[ENTER]you have reached level 66.
5439	Correct. I have carried out further research and[ENTER]found that the seven members of the holy cult[ENTER]were the Dragon Priestesses. In old scrolls they[ENTER]are associated with a theocratic people named the[ENTER]Dark Nation.[ENTER]Were these Dragon Priestesses part of this[ENTER]mysterious nation? Here, read this scroll through[ENTER]carefully and then talk to me again once you are[ENTER]done.
5440	Dark Nation I
5441	According to Uriel's investigations the seven[ENTER]Dragon Priestesses are from the Dark Nation.[ENTER]Examine the old gravestone on Mount Sohan. It is[ENTER]supposed that the capital of the Dark Nation was[ENTER]once at that location. Before you go, speak with[ENTER]Uriel once more.
5442	Their unbelievably high-developed witchcraft and[ENTER]the fact that according to the diary, they have[ENTER]been destroyed by Lee Seop all points to the idea[ENTER]that the seven Dragon Priestesses were actually[ENTER]part of the Dark Nation.
5443	In the old scrolls there is a map. With closer[ENTER]inspection, you can determine that the capital of[ENTER]the Dark Nation must have been located on Mount[ENTER]Sohan.
5445	Unbelievable! Do you understand what this means?![ENTER]Originally there were no demons or spirits in the[ENTER]Demon Tower. How it is now is the legacy of the[ENTER]Dragon Priestess. In a last desperate attempt to[ENTER]defeat Lee Seop's cavalry, she opened the door to[ENTER]this world for the demons using this cursed and[ENTER]dark ritual. At the end, she paid for this with[ENTER]her life.
5444	The Diary
5446	This is the opening that the Death Reaper and his[ENTER]demonic following used to enter our world.[ENTER]However the grand mission of the Dark Nation and[ENTER]the Dragon Priestesses failed: the summoning of[ENTER]Sung Mahi was not successful, Lee Seop to the[ENTER]opposite came to power and finally established a[ENTER]united world kingdom.[ENTER][ENTER]Thanks to your help, I have finally managed to[ENTER]solve the greatest mystery of my life!
5447	For your reward, I would like to present you with[ENTER]a Blessing Scroll. Please take my gift, I insist!
5448	You have post.
5449	The guardian has a letter for you. Read it and[ENTER]find out who the secretive sender is.
5450	You have made yourself pretty scarce recently,[ENTER]eh? I am supposed to give you this letter - no[ENTER]idea who sent it, he didn't introduce himself.
5451	The paper that the letter was written on seems to[ENTER]be very old. In hurried scrawl, the following is[ENTER]written:[ENTER]Have important info on the seven Dragon[ENTER]Priestesses and Sung Mahi. Waiting at the back of[ENTER]the Demon Tower in Hwang Temple for you. Am in[ENTER]the shadow of the tree. Hurry! Time is short!
5452	Anonymous Letter
5453	Go to the Hwang Temple and meet the secretive[ENTER]letter writer at the rear of the Demon Tower.
5454	Lee Chung
5456	Welcome! Allow me to introduce myself first: my[ENTER]name is Lee Chung. It is very brave of you to[ENTER]follow the instructions of someone you don't even[ENTER]know. I have not fooled myself in choosing you -[ENTER]and you will also not regret my decision![ENTER]Listen to what I have to say!
5455	Uriel has news on the last survivor of the Dragon[ENTER]Priestesses. Her diary should be in the Demon[ENTER]Tower. Go to Uriel to find out more.
5457	New Evil
5458	Listen to what Lee Chung has to tell you.
5459	There is one reason why you should come to Hwang[ENTER]Temple: in recent times some very strange things[ENTER]are going on. And just now we discovered an[ENTER]entrance to a massive cave at the back of the[ENTER]Demon Tower!
5460	A gigantic cave? What's inside it?
5461	In this cave, a new, unimaginable evil lies in[ENTER]wait for us. Our scouts talk of a gruesome[ENTER]creature that even makes the demons hide in the[ENTER]shadows. Its terrifying emergence and the[ENTER]insatiable lust for life it has makes us believe[ENTER]that this beast is none other than the legendary[ENTER]Agwi - one of the ten great devils of the demon[ENTER]world.[ENTER]If we are correct, then we are all in very[ENTER]serious danger.
5462	More terrifying than demons... this creature must[ENTER]be truly powerful and vicious.
5463	So it is. My men and I have attempted many times[ENTER]to storm the Devil's Catacomb. But we failed[ENTER]every time and suffered heavy losses.[ENTER]In this matter we need the support of an[ENTER]outstanding warrior - this is why we summoned you[ENTER]here. Will you help us?
5464	Yes, I will help you.
5465	Oh, that gives us new hope![ENTER]Now, as I know that you are standing on our side,[ENTER]I'll tell you the entire truth: I, Lee Chung, am[ENTER]commander of the Shadow Warriors. We are a secret[ENTER]elite unit of Lee Seop's army.
5467	Lee Chung
5466	Ah, good to see you healthy and safe again. Are[ENTER]you ready for a new adventure? We are still[ENTER]missing important information on the Dark Nation[ENTER]and the seven Dragon Priestesses. The final[ENTER]Dragon Priestess must have hidden her diary in[ENTER]the Demon Tower before she carried out the black[ENTER]witchcraft. Head out and bring me the diary.[ENTER]It's possible the Demon King has it in his[ENTER]possession.
5468	The Shadow Warriors have been in pursuit of one[ENTER]goal since that time, to prevent the resurrection[ENTER]of Sung Mahi. That is our mission. Let us attempt[ENTER]together to send this Agwi back to the hell he[ENTER]came from and then find out how he managed to get[ENTER]into our world in the first place!
5469	No Time
5470	Lee Chung, commander of the Shadow Warriors, is[ENTER]searching for you. It is very urgent!
5471	I have an urgent request. Do you see the injured[ENTER]soldier over there?[ENTER]That is one of my scouts, who explored the[ENTER]Devil's Catacomb under my orders. Whilst doing[ENTER]so, he was attacked by the Agwi and poisoned. The[ENTER]poison is spreading across his body - he does not[ENTER]have much time left.
5472	He needs an antidote and he needs it fast![ENTER]Could you fetch some? You can find it in the Red[ENTER]Forest near the Red Dryad.[ENTER]He's one of my best fighters - save his life and[ENTER]I will reward you with %s.
5473	I will fetch the antidote!
5474	Thank you! He's still breathing, but he is[ENTER]getting weaker by the minute. We have no time to[ENTER]lose!
5475	You have %d minutes remaining.
5476	The Antidote
5478	You know from what Lee Chung told you, that the[ENTER]antidote can be found in the Red Forest. Trap %d[ENTER]Red Dryads for this.[ENTER][ENTER]In the Red Forest there are even greater dangers[ENTER]than there are in the Ghost Forest, so be[ENTER]careful.
5477	You have defeated the Demon King and have[ENTER]received the Dragon Priestess's diary. Take it to[ENTER]the learned Uriel. He will analyse it.
5479	The time has expired. The soldier is dying, take[ENTER]the antidote to him as soon as possible.
5480	You have %d minutes remaining.
5481	You have finally found the antidote! Quickly,[ENTER]take it to Lee Chung!
5482	Here, quick! I think you have arrived at exactly[ENTER]the right time. That's a tremendous load off my[ENTER]chest. My men and I are extremely grateful for[ENTER]what you have done.
5483	Thanks to your help, my soldier survived. Here's[ENTER]your reward for saving him.
5484	You took your time. He is clinging with all his[ENTER]strength to his life. Fortunately you have[ENTER]arrived in time.
5485	He seems to be coming through. But that was close[ENTER]- he almost died because you took so long finding[ENTER]the antidote.[ENTER]I'm sorry, but this is all I can give you as a[ENTER]reward.
5486	The Report
5487	The scout has regained conciousness. Listen to[ENTER]what he observed whilst he was in the Devil's[ENTER]Catacomb.
5489	Thank you for saving me. I saw unbelievable[ENTER]things in the Devil's Catacomb. But then I was[ENTER]discovered, and...
5488	You found it! The last Dragon Priestess's diary.[ENTER]My hands are trembling with anticipation![ENTER]I will need a little time to examine its[ENTER]contents. Take some time to rest. I'll call for[ENTER]you when I can tell you more.
5490	What did you see?
5491	There were people in black cloaks with hoods,[ENTER]pulled over their faces.[ENTER]The snippets of their conversation allowed me to[ENTER]work out that they were Servants of the Darkness.[ENTER]But that is not all: A ghastly spirit in the form[ENTER]of a woman floated above their heads. The[ENTER]Servants of the Darkness were calling her[ENTER]Banshee.
5492	That doesn't sound good. What do the Servants of[ENTER]the Darkness and this Banshee have planned?
5493	The Banshee summoned the Agwi using black magic,[ENTER]these devil creatures come directly from the jaws[ENTER]of hell. They call the King of the Agwi Azrael.
5494	I hastily made my way out to inform Lee Chung of[ENTER]this. But I stumbled and was discovered.[ENTER][ENTER]Ah, I just remembered, commander Lee Chung has[ENTER]something important he wants to tell you. I'd[ENTER]head to him now, if I were you.
5495	Dark Threat
5496	Go to Lee Chung and talk to him about the new[ENTER]threat that lurks in the Devil's Catacomb.
5497	What my scouts reported is pretty frightening,[ENTER]right? The Servants of the Darkness, a sect of[ENTER]sorts, are responsible for the appearance of the[ENTER]Agwi. They have also raised the spirit of the[ENTER]final Dragon Priestess. As a Banshee, a[ENTER]manifestation of evil, she has returned to this[ENTER]world and using her magical powers, may soon[ENTER]summon the demon god Sung Mahi.
5498	What?! This Banshee is the spirit of the last[ENTER]Dragon Priestess?!
5500	Without a doubt. Even amongst her sisters of the[ENTER]Dragon cult, only she possessed the power to[ENTER]summon the holy four Heaven's Sentinels and to[ENTER]carry out the black witchcraft.[ENTER]Now we know who is behind this new threat: these[ENTER]Servants of the Darkness and the Banshee plan to[ENTER]complete the work of the Dark Nation and to[ENTER]awaken Sung Mahi!
5499	The Puzzle's Solution
5501	We have a lot to thank you for: you have saved[ENTER]one of my men from certain death and only with[ENTER]that, we were able to learn about the sudden[ENTER]appearance of the Agwi and the latest threat in[ENTER]the Devil's Catacomb. Take a little time to[ENTER]relax, and then we will start thinking about a[ENTER]suitable tactic.
5502	The adventure will continue when you have reached[ENTER]level 72.
5503	Uriel is looking for you. He has now read the[ENTER]diary.
5504	Ah wonderful. There you are.[ENTER]The chronicles of the last Dragon Priestess are[ENTER]truly astounding. Listen well:
5505	My fate is now sealed! I have barricaded myself[ENTER]in the highest floor of this tower and Lee Seop's[ENTER]men are about to break through the door of my[ENTER]final prison. There is no escape, I have lost.[ENTER][ENTER]No! It can't end like this! It cannot all be set[ENTER]already. I have to evoke the black witchcraft,[ENTER]this ancient evil power, by myself and summon the[ENTER]dark forces.[ENTER]It will certainly mean my death. But my enemies[ENTER]will join in my ruin, if it is the last thing[ENTER]that I do!
5507	What, you haven't handed it over yet? The Fishing[ENTER]Pole is for the Fisherman at the river.[ENTER]Hurry up, he needs it urgently!
5506	Another favour
5508	The Blacksmith has sent this new pole!
5509	Thank you. Now I can finally get rid of my trusty[ENTER]but pretty worn Fishing Pole.[ENTER]I don't just earn my living from fishing, but[ENTER]it's also one of the greatest joys of my life![ENTER]Do you know anything about fishing?
5510	Now take the fishing pole in your hand and put a[ENTER]bait on the hook by clicking on it. Then cast it[ENTER]using your fishing skill. When you think you may[ENTER]have caught a fish, use the skill again. If you[ENTER]haven't, then just try again. These waters are[ENTER]very good for fishing due their biodiversity.[ENTER]Fish is not only nutritious and healthy, but can[ENTER]also help you get hold of valuable treasures. You[ENTER]should try it.
5511	Ah yes, here is the payment for the fishing pole.[ENTER]Please give it to the blacksmith when you go back[ENTER]to the village.
5512	Fishing pole delivery receipt
5513	You delivered the fishing pole to the fisherman.[ENTER]Return to the blacksmith with the payment and you[ENTER]will get your reward.
5514	Have you found the Fisherman?[ENTER]Great, you have saved me some valuable time by[ENTER]making that delivery. As a reward, I'm going to[ENTER]give you some Yang and 1,500 experience points.
5515	Voucher
5516	With this voucher, the Blacksmith will upgrade a[ENTER]piece of your equipment for free. Just drag the[ENTER]item you want to improve onto the Blackmsith to[ENTER]open the upgrade-window.
5518	Voucher for one free item upgrade
5517	Please go to the Blacksmith. He needs someone to[ENTER]make a delivery for him.
5519	Hint:
5520	1) The voucher will not be shown in the Inventory.2) A successful refinement - as with any[ENTER]refinement - cannot be 100% guaranteed.
5521	The voucher has already been used.
5522	You have already used the voucher for a free[ENTER]refinement. It is only valid for one refinement.
5523	Greetings adventurer! Could you do me another[ENTER]favour? Normally I don't ask other people to do[ENTER]things for me, but you seem to be quite[ENTER]trustworthy. Think of it as an honour!
5524	I made a fishing pole for the fisherman, but[ENTER]unfortunately, I'm very busy. I don't have time[ENTER]to take it to the fisherman myself. Could you do[ENTER]it for me?
5525	A very flexible fishing pole
5526	The fisherman should be somewhere by the river.[ENTER]If you deliver the fishing pole to the fisherman,[ENTER]I will improve one piece of your equipment for[ENTER]free. That's a fair deal; don't you think?
5527	Find the Fisherman
5528	The blacksmith made a fishing pole for the[ENTER]fisherman. Find the fisherman by the river and[ENTER]give the new fishing pole to him.
5529	Who is the Fishing Pole for?
5531	Heaven's Teardrop gets its perfect brilliance[ENTER]from the magical unison of Hallowed Tree Gum,[ENTER]Blue Crystal Essence and Red Hell Quartz.[ENTER]The Blue Crystal Essence has to be obtained from[ENTER]the ruler of the Ice Land.
5530	Worn Stone Tablet
5532	You have made a note of this striking[ENTER]inscription. Report back to Lee Chung on what you[ENTER]just read.
5533	Ah, you have returned in good health! If I am[ENTER]reading your face correctly, I assume you have[ENTER]had success?
5534	Actually, yes! Thanks to the inscription on the[ENTER]Worn Stone Tablet, I have managed to find out[ENTER]that you can summon the holy powers by using a[ENTER]magical gem, known as Heaven's Teardrop.
5535	Heaven's Teardrop... so it does exist. Have you[ENTER]found any clues as to how we can get hold of it?
5536	In order to produce Heaven's Teardrop, you need[ENTER]Hallowed Tree Gum, Blue Crystal Essence and Red[ENTER]Hell Quartz. It says that Blue Crystal Essence[ENTER]has to be obtained from the ruler of the Ice[ENTER]Land.
5537	The ruler of the Ice Land? Hmm... They must mean[ENTER]Mount Sohan by that.[ENTER]I will show your notes to the Shadow Warrior[ENTER]mages and analyse it with them.[ENTER]I'll be in touch when I know more!
5538	Take this as a reward for your actions. I[ENTER]continue to count on your help!
5539	Icy Treasure
5540	Commander Lee Chung has informed you that the[ENTER]first element required for Heaven's Teardrop,[ENTER]Blue Crystal Essence, has to do with the[ENTER]legendary Nine Tails treasure on Mount Sohan.[ENTER]It is closely watched by Ice Golems, Yetis and[ENTER]Frosty Ice Men. Hunt these monsters to come into[ENTER]possession of the Blue Crystal Essence. Speak[ENTER]with Lee Chung again before you head into battle.
5542	The Shadow Warrior mages have found out that the[ENTER]fearsome Nine Tails of Mount Sohan watches the[ENTER]blue essence as if it is the apple of its eye.
5541	Lee Chung, commander of the Shadow Warriors,[ENTER]would like to talk to you. He has found out how[ENTER]you can defeat the Agwi in the Devil's Catacomb.
5543	The Nine Tails' treasure is guarded by Ice[ENTER]Golems, Yetis and Frosty Ice Men.[ENTER][ENTER]50 Blue Crystal Essences are required to produce[ENTER]Heaven's Teardrop
5544	Red Hell Quartz is believed to be located in[ENTER]either the Hwang Temple or in Fire Land. I have[ENTER]sent out scouts to find out more.
5545	Commander Lee Chung has informed you that the[ENTER]first element required for Heaven's Teardrop,[ENTER]Blue Crystal Essence, has to do with the[ENTER]legendary Nine Tails treasure on Mount Sohan.[ENTER]It is closely watched by Ice Golems, Yetis and[ENTER]Frosty Ice Men. Hunt these monsters to come into[ENTER]possession of the Blue Crystal Essence.
5546	You search through the corpses of the defeated[ENTER]monsters and find a blue, shimmering gemstone.[ENTER]It has to be the Blue Crystal Essence.
5547	You need to seek out %d Blue Crystal Essence(s).
5548	I think you have received enough advice for[ENTER]today. Come back again in the morning.
5549	These crystals are useless. Look for yourself:[ENTER]they have cracks. To be able to use them, they[ENTER]need to be faultless! Keep searching!
5550	These are of excellent quality! Keep it up! I[ENTER]only need %d more.
5551	You have collected all the Blue Crystal Essence[ENTER]we needed. I can feel the power of Nine Tails[ENTER]within them. Amazing... They are positively[ENTER]vibrating with energy. Well done!
5553	The adventure will continue when you have reached[ENTER]level 78.
5552	Unlike the demons we are used to, you cannot[ENTER]simply kill Agwi. We Shadow Warriors have already[ENTER]tried every means we could think of - without[ENTER]success.
5554	But now I have found out that the Dragon[ENTER]Priestesses possessed the power to summon the[ENTER]holy powers in order to banish evil spirits.
5555	In the Red Forest there was one of the Dragon[ENTER]Priestesses' holy temples. Search there for some[ENTER]ruins and any signs of their cult. Scouts have[ENTER]reported about a worn tablet made of stone, which[ENTER]has been covered by brushwood... Maybe we'll find[ENTER]something useful on this stone.
5556	The Discovery
5557	Lee Chung has told you that the Dragon[ENTER]Priestesses were able to summon holy powers, an[ENTER]ancient white magic, which banishes evil spirits.[ENTER]Search in the Red Forest for the Worn Stone[ENTER]Tablet of which Lee Chung spoke, and acquire[ENTER]further evidence.
5558	After a long search, you come across a stone[ENTER]tablet in the undergrowth that seems to have been[ENTER]lying there for centuries. That has to be the old[ENTER]tablet that Lee Chung was talking about! You[ENTER]painstakingly decipher the worn inscription.
5559	Heaven's Teardrop is the most valuable secret of[ENTER]the Dragon Priestesses. The art of its production[ENTER]has been kept secret for generations and in[ENTER]extreme cases, defended with blood. Agwi and[ENTER]demons cannot readily approach the wearer of this[ENTER]magical gem. If Heaven's Teardrop is first filled[ENTER]with the strength of the holy powers, its effects[ENTER]are then overwhelming. It shines as brightly as[ENTER]the polar star in the sky, seven sun discs long.
5561	Ah fantastic! It worked. Here's your Red Hell[ENTER]Quartz.
5560	Red Hell Quartz
5562	Final Element
5563	Lee Chung and the council of mages have[ENTER]discovered that you can acquire the final[ENTER]element, the Hallowed Tree Gum, from the Red Evil[ENTER]Trees. Go on the hunt for them in the Red Forest[ENTER]and collect 100 portions of the tree gum.[ENTER]Speak with Lee Chung first before you head out.
5564	Lee Chung and the council of mages have[ENTER]discovered that you can acquire the final[ENTER]element, the Hallowed Tree Gum, from the Red Evil[ENTER]Trees. Go on the hunt for them in the Red Forest[ENTER]and collect 100 portions of the tree gum.
5565	This is the final step in the production of[ENTER]Heaven's Teardrop. Take care of yourself, the Red[ENTER]Forest is teeming with deadly creatures!
5566	You still need to collect %d portion(s) of the[ENTER]Hallowed Tree Gum.
5567	You have found enough Hallowed Tree Gum! Take it[ENTER]to commander Lee Chung.
5568	Is that the Hallowed Tree Gum? I can feel its[ENTER]enormous power. Fantastic![ENTER]Unfortunately I had to send all the mages on a[ENTER]mission. They will be gone a while. Is there not[ENTER]a chemist in your home town that goes by the name[ENTER]of Baek-Go?
5569	Yes, there actually is.
5570	Ah, superb! Take the three elements and go to[ENTER]Baek-Go. He will be able to create Heaven's[ENTER]Teardrop out of them.
5572	You have a long and exhausting journey behind[ENTER]you. Please, take this reward for all your[ENTER]efforts.
5571	Lee Chung, commander of the Shadow Warriors has[ENTER]found out more about the Red Hell Quartz. To[ENTER]create it, you need three different substances:[ENTER]Volcanic Earth from Doyyumhwan, Flaming Manes and[ENTER]Foundation Stones.[ENTER]Hunt Flames, Flame Warriors and Fighting Tigers[ENTER]in Fire Land to get to these substances and then[ENTER]gather 20 of each to then form 20 pieces of Red[ENTER]Hell Quartz.[ENTER]Speak with Lee Chung again before you head into[ENTER]battle.
5573	Heaven's Teardrop
5574	Return back to your home town, seek out Baek-Go[ENTER]and ask him to create Heaven's Teardrop out of[ENTER]the three elements in the name of Lee Chung.
5575	You've been away for some time. I was beginning[ENTER]to ask myself whether something had happened to[ENTER]you. What brings you to me?
5576	Lee Chung has asked me to come to you for a[ENTER]favour.
5577	Lee Chung?! The commander of the Shadow War...[ENTER]Oh! Shhhhh! Quiet! Before you stands a Shadow[ENTER]Warrior mage. But that information is top secret,[ENTER]nobody in the village can know this.[ENTER]What favour does Lee Chung want to ask of me?
5578	He requests that you create Heaven's Teardrop out[ENTER]of these three elements.
5579	Heaven's Teardrop eh... He has so many mages at[ENTER]his disposal, why does he always leave the[ENTER]difficult tasks to me?![ENTER]...[ENTER]OK. Here we are then, Heaven's Teardrop.[ENTER]Beautiful! I will send it directly to Lee Chung[ENTER]via messenger and he will call for you when[ENTER]everything is ready. Can you tell me what it is[ENTER]for?
5580	I can't really tell you anything more specific.[ENTER]Only this: this stone summons the holy powers in[ENTER]order to banish demons and other evil creatures.
5581	Very interesting. I wish you the best of success[ENTER]in your task. As a reward for your actions so[ENTER]far, here's two Shrunken Heads.[ENTER]Now that I know how the process works, I am happy[ENTER]to help you should you need any further Heaven's[ENTER]Tears.[ENTER]Oh and would you send my best regards to Lee[ENTER]Chung too?
5583	The adventure will continue when you have reached[ENTER]level 84.
5582	Our mages have discovered that the Red Hell[ENTER]Quartz needed for the production of Heaven's[ENTER]Teardrop carries the power of fire within it.[ENTER]This quartz must also be the reason for the[ENTER]unbelievable strength of the creatures in Fire[ENTER]Land.
5584	Red Hell Quartz is created from three substances:[ENTER]Volcanic Earth, Flaming Mane and Foundation[ENTER]Stone. You can find all of them in Fire Land.
5585	You did it! Finally we have the %d pieces of Red[ENTER]Hell Quartz that we needed. Your bravery and[ENTER]strength have exceeded my expectations again!
5586	One substance is missing. We need Volcanic Earth,[ENTER]Flaming Mane as well as Foundation Stone.
5587	I'm sorry, but I can only produce seven pieces of[ENTER]Red Hell Quartz per day. This procedure is a[ENTER]challenge for my magical skills. I'm not even a[ENTER]mage!
5588	So then! I will now mix the three substances[ENTER]together and attempt to make a Red Hell Quartz.
5589	Argh! The magic failed. Apparently I[ENTER]overestimated my magical capabilities. Next time[ENTER]will work better for sure.
5591	Now that you have defeated General Tartaros, an[ENTER]entrance to a before-hidden floor of the Devil's[ENTER]Catacomb has opened. Prince Charon must be down[ENTER]there! Teleport to the sixth floor and face the[ENTER]prince of the Agwi. But careful! he is extremely[ENTER]strong and cunning like a devil.
5590	The Fight Begins
5592	The way you move through the Devil's Catacomb -[ENTER]freely and without fear - it's impossible that[ENTER]you are just a mere mortal![ENTER]The basalt obelisk on the fifth floor will act as[ENTER]a portal to the hidden sixth floor.
5593	Prince Charon delivers all his commands to[ENTER]Agwi-General Tartaros from there.[ENTER]What are you waiting for? Defeat Charon and[ENTER]frustrate the sinister plans of the Servants of[ENTER]Darkness and the Banshee!
5594	You did it! Charon, prince over the Agwi, has[ENTER]been annihilated.
5595	Exhausted but relieved, you wipe the sweat from[ENTER]your brow.[ENTER]Suddenly a shrill laughter shocks through the[ENTER]Devil's Catacomb, so piercing that cuts to the[ENTER]core of you:[ENTER]Ahahahaha! Too late, you pathetic humans! Our[ENTER]master Sung Mahi has already risen and there is[ENTER]nothing you can do to stop it now![ENTER]The day draws near that Sung Mahi will reach his[ENTER]full strength on the island where the evil[ENTER]dragons sleep. Your world is doomed!
5596	Unfinished Story
5597	Go to Lee Chung and report the Banshee's[ENTER]threatening message to him.
5598	After you report your victories over Tartaros and[ENTER]Charon to the commander, you repeat the Banshee's[ENTER]formidable message. With a serious look on his[ENTER]face, he starts to talk:
5599	I had assumed that once we defeated the[ENTER]Agwi-prince we would frustrate the plans of the[ENTER]Servants of Darkness and the Banshee. How wrong I[ENTER]was...
5600	The Banshee must have managed to complete the[ENTER]resurrection of Sung Mahi together with Azrael,[ENTER]king over the Agwi. I shiver at the thought of[ENTER]it...
5602	The island on which the evil dragons sleep...[ENTER]Hmm, they must mean the Dark Dragon Rock by that.[ENTER]It's an uncharted island far away from here.[ENTER]Even if we have not achieved what we had hoped[ENTER]to, we still owe you a great deal of gratitude.[ENTER]Without your help we would never have been able[ENTER]to uncover the cause of the mischief that lurked[ENTER]in the depths of the Devil's Catacomb.
5601	Lee Chung has received Heaven's Teardrop and has[ENTER]prepared everything for your mission into the[ENTER]Devil's Catacomb. Go to him to find out more.
5603	You have accomplished truly great deeds, deeds[ENTER]that no-one but you were capable of. I will be[ENTER]ready to stand by your side whenever you shall[ENTER]need it, for the rest of my life. Farewell!
5604	Now that we hold Heaven's Teardrop in our hands,[ENTER]it is only a question of time before we defeat[ENTER]the Servants of Darkness and expel the Agwi out[ENTER]of our world! But the teardrop's entire power[ENTER]will only unleash itself when it is deployed in a[ENTER]specific location in Devil's Catacomb.
5605	We know of five floors in the Devil's Catacomb.[ENTER]On the fifth and final floor that we know of, you[ENTER]will come across Tartaros, the terrifying Agwi[ENTER]General and third-in-line behind King Azrael and[ENTER]Charon. Defeat him with the help of Heaven's[ENTER]Teardrop!
5606	But where is Charon?
5607	General Tartaros
5608	Only use the Heaven's Teardrop when you have[ENTER]reached the fifth floor of the Devil's Catacomb.[ENTER]The entrance to the Devil's Catacomb can be found[ENTER]at the rear of the Demon Tower.
5609	The holy powers begin to take effect within the[ENTER]Heaven's Teardrop. You feel a tremendous power[ENTER]flow through your body. The power of this stone[ENTER]is completely mind-blowing![ENTER][ENTER]Defeat General Tartaros.
5610	Prince Charon
5611	Find the City Guard
5612	Talk to the City Guard
5613	You have taken the first steps on the way to[ENTER]becoming a true hero. It is now time for bigger[ENTER]things. Go to the City Guard and get your last[ENTER]beginner's mission from him.
5614	Are you ready to tackle some more difficult[ENTER]tasks? Remember that the time of easy tasks will[ENTER]be over once you have decided to fight for your[ENTER]kingdom. You will have to endure lots of battles[ENTER]and endless amounts of suffering. So be on your[ENTER]guard. Here, this is a reward for your previous[ENTER]efforts. I hope it comes in useful.
5615	From now on, the Captain will guide you. He will[ENTER]supervise your progress and give you tasks to[ENTER]help train you. Practise in battle and go see him[ENTER]afterwards. Good luck!
5616	You have received 9,500 experience points.
5617	Dark Dragon Rock
5618	Your journey was long and arduous. But now you[ENTER]have finally reached your goal: Dark Dragon Rock.[ENTER]Seek out Admiral Angur. You will find him at Cape[ENTER]Dragon Fire.
5619	Welcome to Dark Dragon Rock, stranger! Have you[ENTER]come to help us in the fight against Sung Mahi?
5620	Yes, absolutely. Lee Chung, Commander of the[ENTER]Shadow Warriors, sent me.
5621	Lee Chung! He is a long time companion of mine.[ENTER]So you're here at his request. Aye, then I know[ENTER]that I can trust you.
5622	I thank you. What's the situation here then?
5623	Demons rule over large parts of the island.[ENTER]Nothing and no one is safe from them. They are[ENTER]even eating each other. The dark influence of[ENTER]Sung Mahi has made them all lose their minds.
5624	I could use your help. Could you explore the[ENTER]island and give me an up-to-date report of the[ENTER]situation?
5625	Naturally.
5627	Understood.
5626	I thank you. Wait, I'll show you the way.
5628	You are very diligent, but that's not enough.[ENTER]Keep collecting!
5629	Collect Clay Bricks
5630	Head into battle against the Manticores to gather[ENTER]Clay Bricks.
5631	You have collected enough Clay Bricks.
5632	Deliver them to Admiral Angmur.
5633	Talk to Admiral Angmur.
5634	Very good, thanks to you we have enough materials[ENTER]to strengthen the defensive rampart. As soon as[ENTER]we are finished with that, I'll send a summons[ENTER]for you.
5635	Lee Chung's task
5636	Lee Chung has a task for you.
5637	Unfortunately there's some bad news that brings[ENTER]us back together: the Servants of the Darkness[ENTER]are close to their goal. Soon Sung Mahi will be[ENTER]undefeatable.[ENTER]We have no time to lose! Go to the teleporter.[ENTER]From there a ship will take you to Dark Dragon[ENTER]Rock. Seek out Admiral Angmur there. I have[ENTER]already sent a letter announcing your arrival.
5639	I'll leave straight away.
5638	Explore Dark Dragon Rock. Go here first: (%d, %d). 
5640	Leave for the Island
5641	Go to the Teleporter. It will bring you to Dark[ENTER]Dragon Rock.
5642	The arrow above the NPC shows you that this[ENTER]person wants to talk to you. If you cannot see[ENTER]the NPC on your screen, follow the flashing dot[ENTER]on the minimap.
5643	Follow the flashing dot on the minimap.
5644	Remaining
5645	
5646	%s : %d pieces
5648	The adventure continues as soon as you have[ENTER]reached level 91.
5647	Situation Report
5649	Take a look around the island and then report[ENTER]your findings to Admiral Angmur afterwards.
5650	This is your first destination: %d, %d
5651	You have reached your first destination.[ENTER]The next one is: (%d, %d)
5652	You have not yet explored all areas.[ENTER]Please explore everywhere.
5653	Your second destination is: %d, %s
5654	You have reached your second destination.[ENTER]The next one is: (%d, %d)
5655	
5656	
5657	Your third destination is: %d, %d
5658	You have explored all regions.[ENTER]Return to Admiral Angmur.
5659	Talk to Admiral Angmur.
5660	After you have wandered through the entire[ENTER]island, the following realisation has become[ENTER]clear to you: everywhere is teeming with demons.
5661	You've done well. Take this here as a thank-you[ENTER]for your help.
5662	Lee Chung's Letter
5663	Whilst you give your account of the current[ENTER]situation on Dark Dragon Rock, Admiral Angmur's[ENTER]facial expression darkens.
5664	I would have liked to have brought you better[ENTER]news.
5665	The demons on the island are getting ever[ENTER]stronger. If we are unable to stop Sung Mahi and[ENTER]the Servants of Darkness, may the Dragon God have[ENTER]mercy upon us.
5666	Yes, I'll admit that it seems pretty bleak.
5667	Aye, you can say that again...[ENTER]Lee Chung must have uncovered a decisive clue. He[ENTER]sent me a letter with some important information.[ENTER]But it never reached me. The message was[ENTER]intercepted by the gnolls.
5668	We need to find this letter. Can you help us?
5669	Of course. I'm already on my way.
5670	I thank you. The gnolls are settled quite close[ENTER]to here.
5671	Find Lee Chung's Letter.
5672	One of the following creatures has Lee Chung's[ENTER]Letter: Gnoll Warrior, Gnoll Archer, Gnoll[ENTER]Defender, Gnoll Magician, Gnoll General, Gnoll[ENTER]Lord or the Supreme Gnoll Guard
5673	If we want to stop Sung Mahi, we need this letter!The thief comes from the ranks of the gnoll tribe.
5674	You have found the letter.
5675	Bring it to Admiral Angmur!
5676	Talk to Admiral Angmur.
5677	You're back and you have the letter! Aye, I knew[ENTER]that I could count on you. Let's see it then.
5678	Greetings Angmur![ENTER]My friend, in Sung Mahi's empty camps we came[ENTER]across something: the Servants of Darkness have[ENTER]approached their allies on the island using[ENTER]secret messages. One such message was sent to the[ENTER]Gnoll Tribe. If you could intercept this, we'll[ENTER]be an important step ahead of the demons! I'm[ENTER]sending %s as support and wish you strength and[ENTER]courage in this dark time.[ENTER]L.C.
5679	My scouts will find out whether the gnolls have[ENTER]already received the letter or not. In the[ENTER]meanwhile, take this here as a thank-you.
5680	The Gnoll Letter I
5681	Admiral Angmur is looking for you. Find out what[ENTER]he wants.
5682	The Gnoll General has already received the letter[ENTER]sent by the Servants. Can you obtain it for us?[ENTER]Be careful though: gnolls are extremely[ENTER]aggressive.[ENTER]They attack first and ask their questions later.
5683	I'm already on my way.
5684	Thanks. I knew we could count on you.
5685	Find the Gnoll Letter!
5686	Find the Gnoll General. He has the letter!
5687	We have no time to lose. Please hurry and bring[ENTER]me the letter.
5688	You have obtained the Gnoll Letter.
5689	Bring it to Admiral Angmur.
5690	Talk to Admiral Angmur.
5691	You have the letter! Finally some good news eh?[ENTER]Hmm...[ENTER]I cannot read a single word. The letter seems to[ENTER]be encrypted. Our scholar knows his way around[ENTER]cryptology. I'll seek him out directly. As soon[ENTER]as I know more, I'll be in touch.
5692	
5693	
5694	The Gnoll Letter II
5695	Admiral Angmur is looking for you. It seems to be[ENTER]important. Find out what he wants.
5696	The encrypted letter consists of two pages. The[ENTER]message can only be decoded when the two sheets[ENTER]are laid over one another. Lord Gnoll has the[ENTER]second sheet.[ENTER]Can you help us?
5697	Of course.
5698	Thank you. You help is invaluable!
5699	The Gnoll Letter II
5700	Find the second sheet of the Gnoll Letter! You[ENTER]will get it from Lord Gnoll.
5701	Time is running out! Hurry and find the second[ENTER]sheet of the letter.
5702	You have found the second sheet. Bring it to[ENTER]Admiral Angmur.
5703	Excellent, now we can decode the message: Hmm, it[ENTER]seems to be talking about dragons that sleep deep[ENTER]in the heart of the world. It speaks of a method[ENTER]with which you can awaken them and make them mad.[ENTER]Oh ho! That does not sound good...
5704	
5705	It seems the Manticores and the Red Thief Gang[ENTER]have also received letters. I will find out more[ENTER]about this news and then call for you.
5706	Admiral Angmur has a task for you.
5707	The Manticores
5708	Admiral Angmur has a new task for you.
5709	Good, you are here! Our information on the[ENTER]manticores is quite old. We need to find out how[ENTER]strong their forces currently are.
5710	Can you go and spy on them? Their camp is not far[ENTER]from here.
5711	Sure. What should I do?
5712	Defeat 50 Manticore Warriors, 40 Manticore[ENTER]Soldiers, 20 Manticore Executioners as well as[ENTER]defeating General Cor 10 times.[ENTER]Then report back to me.
5713	Remaining
5714	%s: %d[ENTER]%s: %d
5715	The information you've got is not enough. You[ENTER]need to find out more.
5716	You have gathered the required amount of[ENTER]information on the manticores.
5717	Report your findings back to Admiral Angmur.
5718	Have you completed your task? Very good. Then[ENTER]give me a report of the current situation.
5719	The forces of the manticores is not particularly[ENTER]large. You have the advantage in the numbers[ENTER]game.[ENTER]But their warriors are well trained and are[ENTER]extremely tough.[ENTER]I would recommend that you strengthen the defence[ENTER]wall around the fort. It will not currently[ENTER]resist a manticore onslaught.
5720	Aye, that is the information that we need. I will[ENTER]take your advice and strengthen the defensive[ENTER]wall.[ENTER]Please take this as a reward.
5721	Talk to Admiral Angmur
5722	The Manticore Forces
5723	Defeat 50 Manticore Warriors, 40 Manticore[ENTER]Soldiers, 20 Manticore Executioners as well as[ENTER]defeating General Cor 10 times.
5724	Strengthen the Rampart I
5725	Admiral Angmur is looking for you. It seems to be[ENTER]important. Go to him immediately.
5726	Ah, there you are. You were right, our rampart[ENTER]would not have withstood any attack. But we don't[ENTER]have the materials we need to strengthen it.
5727	We need Clay Bricks and Fine Sand. Can you get[ENTER]hold of these building materials for us?
5728	Naturally.
5729	Very good. First search for the Fine Sand. The[ENTER]gnolls have a large supply of it. 50 buckets[ENTER]should be enough.
5730	Fine Sand
5731	Fight against the gnolls and get hold of 50[ENTER]buckets of Fine Sand.
5732	Unfortunately, what you have there is not enough.[ENTER]We need more Fine Sand. Please keep collecting.
5733	You have now collected enough Fine Sand.
5734	Deliver it to Admiral Angmur.
5735	OK.
5736	I thank you! With the Fine Sand we will now be[ENTER]able to strengthen the rampart.[ENTER]My men will get to work straight away.[ENTER]I will call for you as soon as we need your help[ENTER]again.
5737	Strengthen the Rampart II
5738	Admiral Angmur is asking for your help. Find out[ENTER]what he wants.
5739	To finish the construction, we need Clay Bricks.[ENTER]The manticores hoard these like gold. I think[ENTER]that 100 bricks should do the trick. You will, of[ENTER]course, be generously rewarded for your help.
5740	The Manticore Letter
5741	Admiral Angmur has a new task for you.
5742	Aye, it is time once again to turn our attention[ENTER]to the scheming of the Servants of Darkness.[ENTER]We need to bring the letters that they sent the[ENTER]manticores and the red thieves into our[ENTER]possession![ENTER]Pay a visit to the manticores first.
5743	
5744	Yes Sir.
5745	General Cor has headed out with the letter to[ENTER]give it to Martyaxwar. You have to stop the[ENTER]handover!
5746	The Manticore Letter
5747	Defeat General Cor and find the letter.
5748	You have arrived too late. Martyaxwar has already[ENTER]received the letter.
5749	Report back to Admiral Angmur.
5750	You are too late. I have already given Martyaxwar[ENTER]the letter. The fate of the humans is sealed!
5751	Report back to Admiral Angmur.
5752	There you are at last. Do you have the letter?
5753	No, I was too late - General Cor had already[ENTER]given the letter to Martyaxwar.
5754	
5755	Aye, well does not make the situation any[ENTER]easier...[ENTER]My scouts will seek out Martyaxwar's location.[ENTER]Here, take this as a reward in the meantime. I[ENTER]will inform you as soon as I hear anything new.
5756	Martyaxwar's Hideout
5757	Admiral Angmur is looking for you. He knows where[ENTER]Martyaxwar is located.
5758	There you are finally! We now know Martyaxwar's[ENTER]location. My scouts have also observed that he[ENTER]has placed the letter in his Barb Necklace, the[ENTER]one he never removes.
5759	I'll get going right away.
5760	Defeat Martyaxwar.
5761	Hunt Martyaxwar down and take his Barb Necklace[ENTER]from him.
5762	We cannot lose any time. Hurry and bring me the[ENTER]Barb Necklace!
5763	You have received the Barb Necklace. The letter[ENTER]is found in a pocket on the inside of it.
5764	Bring it to Admiral Angmur.
5765	Go to Admiral Angmur.
5766	Good work. That was no easy opponent. We can only[ENTER]hope that the letter tells us more about the[ENTER]demons' sinister plans.
5767	Dammit, I thought just as much - it's encrypted[ENTER]again! Yon-I-Walker, our scholar, should take a[ENTER]look at it. Go to him please.
5768	Decoding
5769	Go to Yon-I-Walker to have the letter decoded.
5770	*mumble* Woah, I spooked myself![ENTER]Who are you?
5771	Admiral Angmur has sent me.
5772	Ah, yes! You are here because of the letter.[ENTER]Angmur has already told me about it.
5773	I was not able to decrypt the letter yet. But it[ENTER]seems to be the script of the crustacean tribe[ENTER]who dwell in Nephrite Bay.
5774	To be able to interpret these characters, I need[ENTER]the crustacean tribe's Carapax Script. Can you[ENTER]get hold of ten of them for me?
5775	Of course.
5776	Carapax Script
5777	Head into battle against the crustacean tribe and[ENTER]get hold of ten Carapax Scripts.
5778	This Carapax Script has unfortunately been[ENTER]damaged and I cannot use it. Please bring me[ENTER]another one.
5779	You have found the Carapax Scripts. They have the[ENTER]form of turtle shells.
5780	Perfect now I can decrypt the letter. Good work![ENTER]Take this here as a sign of my gratitude.
5781	Bring me %s more pieces.
5782	You have found a Carapax Script.
5783	Deliver it to Yon-I-Walker.
5784	Manticore letter decoded.
5785	Yon-I-Walker is looking for you. Go to him and[ENTER]find out whether he was already able to decrypt[ENTER]the letter or not.
5786	*mumble* ...ah! There you are! Thanks to your[ENTER]help I was able to decrypt a large part of the[ENTER]message.[ENTER]But I'm not making any progress on the last part.[ENTER]I fear that I need to ask your help once more. I[ENTER]urgently need Carapax Powder. You can find it on[ENTER]General Lobster or King Crab of the crustacean[ENTER]tribe.
5787	Carapax Powder?
5788	Yes, only the crustacean tribe have it in their[ENTER]possession. Even a small dose of this powder is[ENTER]lethal! Three doses should be enough. Good luck.
5789	I'll set out on my way immediately.
5790	Carapax Powder
5791	Go up against General Lobster and King Crab of[ENTER]the crustacean tribe and obtain three doses of[ENTER]Carapax Powder.
5792	Carapax Powder is extremely poisonous. I need to[ENTER]wait a day in order for its effects to diminish.[ENTER]Come by again tomorrow, hopefully I will then be[ENTER]able to tell you more.
5793	You have the Carapax Powder!
5794	Good work. Now I can finally decrypt the letter.[ENTER]Please take this as a reward.
5795	Bring me %d more pieces!
5796	This Carapax Powder is contaminated. Please bring[ENTER]me a new dose.
5797	You have found a dose of Carapax Powder.
5798	Bring it to Yon-I-Walker.
5799	Poisoned!
5800	Admiral Angmur is needs you urgently. Find out[ENTER]what it is that he needs.
5801	There you are! Praise be to the Dragon God.[ENTER]Yon-I-Walker has been poisoned by the Carapax[ENTER]Powder.
5802	He wanted to hurry and got careless. What makes[ENTER]matters worse is that our supply of medicinal[ENTER]herbs is used up.[ENTER]Seek out the Rock Flower - its roots can[ENTER]neutralise the poison. I've marked the locations[ENTER]where you can find it on the map.
5803	Of course.
5804	I knew that I could rely on you. Please hurry, we[ENTER]don't have much time!
5805	Save Yon-I-Walker!
5806	Find the Rock Flower Roots, to be able to heal[ENTER]the poisoned Yon-I-Walker.
5807	Bring Yon-I-Walker the Rock Flower Root.
5808	*cough*[ENTER]*hack*[ENTER]Ah, it's you. I'm not doing well at all. Have you[ENTER]found the Rock Flower Roots?
5809	Yeah, I have them here.
5810	Ah, I already feel better. It seems my time has[ENTER]not come after all.[ENTER]I thank you. Take this as a reward. Now I can[ENTER]complete my work. Admiral Angmur will inform you[ENTER]as soon as I am able to decrypt the letter.
5811	Yon-I-Walker wants to talk to you.
5812	Remaining
5813	%s: %d
5814	The adventure continues as soon as you have[ENTER]reached level 92.
5815	The Red Thief Letter
5816	The final letter sent by the Servants of Darkness[ENTER]is with the Red Thief Gang. Admiral Angmur has[ENTER]more information for you.
5817	We are coming ever closer to the plotting of the[ENTER]Servants of Darkness. The final letter is[ENTER]currently in the hands of the Red Thief Gang.
5818	The Red Thief Gang?
5819	They are a group of criminals who were banished[ENTER]to Dark Dragon Rock. The strange thing about the[ENTER]red thieves is that here humans have allied with[ENTER]demons.
5820	Demons, who have allied with humans instead of[ENTER]eating them? Curious.
5821	They are united by a shared goal: gold.[ENTER]The red thief camp is not far from here. Defeat[ENTER]the Red Thief Executioner and the Black General.[ENTER]One of them has the letter.
5822	However they were warned of our intentions in[ENTER]sufficient time and they have now torn the letter[ENTER]into four pieces. We need to find them all.
5823	Understood.
5824	Thank you.
5825	The Red Thief Letter
5826	Fight the Red Thief Executioner and the Black[ENTER]General. Find all four pieces of the letter.
5827	The letter is not yet complete. Find all the[ENTER]pieces.
5828	You have found all parts of the Red Thief Letter.
5829	Show it to Admiral Angmur.
5830	Talk to Admiral Angmur.
5831	Good work. Here, take this as a mark of my[ENTER]gratitude.
5832	The Red Thief Letter
5833	Admiral Angmur needs your help.
5834	Good that you are here. We have a problem.
5835	What's going on?
5836	There is actually a fifth piece to the Red Thief[ENTER]Letter. Without this piece, the rest of the[ENTER]letter is worthless. I have already sent[ENTER]Bae-Yong, one of my bravest men, but something[ENTER]must have happened.[ENTER]He should have been back a long time ago. Can you[ENTER]search for him?
5837	Of course! Do you know where he could be now?
5838	An idea, yes. He last mentioned that he wanted to[ENTER]head to Nephrite Bay. But nobody can say for sure[ENTER]whether he got there or not.
5839	I'll be on my way immediately.
5840	The Missing Soldier
5841	Find the fifth piece of the letter. To do so,[ENTER]look for Bae-Yong in Nephrite Bay.
5842	You haven't found Bae-Yong yet?[ENTER]This is a matter of life and death! Please keep[ENTER]looking.
5843	*cough*[ENTER]Thank you for finding me. I was heavily injured[ENTER]in battle and I fear that I do not have much time[ENTER]left...[ENTER]Here, I took this from a red thief. Take it to[ENTER]the Admiral. Go! I'll be o...[ENTER](He dies in your arms.)
5844	Before Bae-Yong died, he gave you the missing[ENTER]piece of the letter.
5845	Head back to Admiral Angmur.
5846	You are back! Did you find Bae-Yong?
5847	Yes, but...
5848	But?[ENTER]Oh no. Is he dead?
5849	I couldn't do anymore for him. My condolences. He[ENTER]was a brave man – he defended the final piece of[ENTER]the letter with is life. Here it is.
5850	The loss of Bae-Yong hurts us badly. But I am[ENTER]very proud of him. He completed his mission – we[ENTER]now have all the pieces of the letter.
5851	I thank you for everything. Here, take this here[ENTER]as a reward.[ENTER]I'm going to light a incense stick in the temple[ENTER]for Bae-Yong now.[ENTER]I'll call on you later.
5852	Go to Admiral Angmur.
5853	Decrypt the Red Thief Letter
5854	Admiral Angmur has important news on the Red[ENTER]Thief Letter.[ENTER]Listen to what he has to say.
5855	Ah there you are. The Servants of Darkness are[ENTER]giving me a headache. This letter is also[ENTER]encrypted. Please take it to Yon-I-Walker.
5856	As you wish.
5857	Take the encrypted letter to Yon-I-Walker.
5858	Argh! Do you always have to sneak up on me like[ENTER]that?![ENTER]What can I do for you?
5859	Here is the Red Thief Letter. Just like the[ENTER]others, this one is encrypted.
5860	Let me have a look. Hmm, this looks to be the[ENTER]characters of the tritons. Decrypting them[ENTER]shouldn't be too difficult.
5861	Excellent. How long do you need for it?
5862	Not so fast. The decryption is not particularly[ENTER]complicated, but without further resources it[ENTER]won't work.
5863	Of course not. That would have been too easy.
5864	I see you have not lost your sense of humour,[ENTER]hehe.[ENTER]To decrypt the letter, I need Oin Scales. Of the[ENTER]tribe of tritons, only General Kappa and Triton[ENTER]himself may wear these rare scales. Please get[ENTER]ten of them.
5865	I'll head out right away.
5866	Find Oin Scales!
5867	Only Triton, King of the Tritons and General[ENTER]Kappa wear Oin Scales.
5868	I cannot decrypt the letter without these scales.[ENTER]I need them urgently.
5869	You have found the tritonic Oin Scales.
5870	Quickly take them to Yon-I-Walker.
5871	You have done well. As soon as I have decrypted[ENTER]the letter, I will let Admiral Angmur know.[ENTER]You should rest up a little. Here, take this as a[ENTER]token of my appreciation.
5872	Yon-I-Walker would like to talk to you.
5873	Dark Plans
5874	The letter from the Servants of Darkness has been[ENTER]decrypted. Admiral Angmur wants to tell you about[ENTER]the sinister plans.
5875	We have managed to completely decrypt the secret[ENTER]message. Do you remember the letter sent to the[ENTER]gnolls? There they already spoke of dragons,[ENTER]sleeping deep in the island, as well as a method[ENTER]for waking them up and making them full of rage.[ENTER]Now we have found out for what purpose the[ENTER]Servants of Darkness are pursing this.
5876	If you then kill a dragon at this moment, when[ENTER]its mind is as black as the jaws of hell, it[ENTER]spits a Pearl of the Night out. With the help of[ENTER]this pearl, the immeasurable powers of Sung Mahi[ENTER]can be summoned to our world. That's their[ENTER]sinister plan!
5877	Our next steps need to be well thought out. As[ENTER]soon as I have any news for you, I will call for[ENTER]you. Thank you for everything.
5878	The adventure continues as soon as you reach[ENTER]level 93.
5879	Stocking Up On Power I
5880	Admiral Angmur wants to talk to you.
5881	We are hot on the heels of the Servants of[ENTER]Darkness.
5882	To defeat them, we need to strengthen your powers.Do you know of the Inner Light? It is[ENTER]concentrated energy. Some mythical beings or[ENTER]plants have it in them. Yon-I-Walker can make a[ENTER]tonic from it. Go to him next.
5883	Understood.
5884	Ah, there's my saviour![ENTER]The Inner Light, oh yes... my tonic will make you[ENTER]an equal opponent for the Servants of Darkness.
5885	For this I need the Inner Light of the cyclops[ENTER]and the giants. Only the tribe leaders of each of[ENTER]these groups will have it inside them. Take the[ENTER]cyclops on first.
5886	Understood.
5887	The Inner Light I
5888	Defeat Polyphemos, King of the Cyclops, and loot[ENTER]his Inner Light.
5889	You're back with empty hands? I can't help you[ENTER]like this. Bring me the Inner Light!
5890	You have found the Inner Light. Bring it to[ENTER]Yon-I-Walker.
5891	Talk to Yon-I-Walker.
5892	So this is the Inner Light... before I work on[ENTER]it, it needs to be cleaned. That will take some[ENTER]time.[ENTER]I'll let you know when it's ready.
5893	Stocking Up On Power II
5894	Yon-I-Walker is looking for you.
5895	The Inner Light of Polyphemos is now clean. Next[ENTER]up we need the one that belongs to the giants.[ENTER]You'll need to defeat King Wubba to get it.
5896	I'll head out straight away.
5897	The Inner Light II
5898	Defeat the giant's king, King Wobba, and loot his[ENTER]Inner Light.
5899	You come back empty-handed? It would surprise me[ENTER]if you are not up to this task. Head out there[ENTER]and try again!
5900	You are holding the Inner Light of the giants in[ENTER]your hands.
5901	Take it to Yon-I-Walker.
5902	Talk to Yon-I-Walker.
5903	The Inner Light of King Wobba possesses enormous[ENTER]power. I believe that comes from the size. I now[ENTER]need to clean it. This will take a while.
5904	Stocking Up On Power III
5905	Yon-I-Walker is looking for you.
5906	You are here, excellent. I need your help. In[ENTER]order for the effects of my tonic to fully[ENTER]develop, I need one further component: the[ENTER]Millennium Essence.
5907	Millennium Essence? Never heard of it.
5908	It is a very effective mixture made from various[ENTER]herb essences. Do you know Octavio? He lives on[ENTER]the mainland and is the only one who is capable[ENTER]of producing the Millennium Essence. Go to him. I[ENTER]hope he will help us. He can be a bit stubborn...
5909	Understood.
5910	Talk to Octavio!
5911	Seek out Octavio. He lives on the mainland and is[ENTER]the only one who can brew the Millennium Essence.
5912	Hello! What can I get you? A Samgyetang perhaps?[ENTER]It's a house speciality with...
5913	Octavio, I'm not here for the good food! I need[ENTER]something rather different: the Millennium[ENTER]Essence.
5914	Woah, psssst, not so loud! The Millennium[ENTER]Essence...[ENTER]No, that's not possible. How do you know of this?[ENTER]Only a few can handle the power that it provides.[ENTER]I don't want to take the risk. Go now, before[ENTER]anyone else hears you.
5915	Octavio, wait and listen! Yon-I-Walker from Dark[ENTER]Dragon Rock sent me. We need this essence[ENTER]urgently. Without it, we have no chance against[ENTER]the Servants of Darkness. And then the world as[ENTER]we know it, is doomed. Only you can produce the[ENTER]essence. Please!
5916	Yon-I-Walker you say? Hmm, he's an old friend of[ENTER]mine. We have had many a good chat with a better[ENTER]bottle of wine. I need to think about it. Come[ENTER]again in the morning and then I will give you my[ENTER]answer.
5917	
5918	I haven't decided yet. Come again later.
5919	The Millennium Essence
5920	Octavio wants to talk to you.
5921	So, I have thought about your request the entire[ENTER]night. I am taking a huge risk in this, but I am[ENTER]sure that I am doing the right thing. Yes, I will[ENTER]help you.
5922	Excellent!
5923	However I don't have it in supply at the moment.[ENTER]Can you get hold of a few ingredients for me?[ENTER]Then I will produce the essence for you.
5924	Of course. What do you need?
5925	I'm missing Gango Root, Tue Fungus and Alpine[ENTER]Rose. I need 200 of each ingredient.
5926	I'll head out immediately. Where can I find them[ENTER]all?
5927	You will find these plants at the most different[ENTER]locations on the continent.[ENTER]Whilst you are searching, I will start my[ENTER]preparations here.
5928	The Millennium Recipe
5929	Search for Gango Root, the Tue Fungus and the[ENTER]Alpine Rose.[ENTER]You need 200 of each of them.
5930	You will find these plants at the most different[ENTER]of locations on the continent.[ENTER]Whilst you are searching, I will start here with[ENTER]my preparations.
5931	Ah, you are back, very good. And you have[ENTER]everything with you. Then I shall get to work[ENTER]immediately. I must not be interrupted during[ENTER]this time. Come back tomorrow at the same time.[ENTER]By then the essence should be ready.
5932	Got it. See you tomorrow.
5933	I understand that you have an urgent need for it,[ENTER]but you need to be patient a little while longer.[ENTER]Come back again later.
5934	Octavio is looking for you.
5935	Ah, you have come at exactly the right time: the[ENTER]Millennium Essence has just now become ready for[ENTER]use! You can now take it to Yon-I-Walker.
5936	Thank you.
5937	Millennium Essence
5938	Yon-I-Walker is looking for you.
5939	You have the Millennium Essence![ENTER]Now I have all the ingredients for my tonic. I[ENTER]shall call for you as soon as it is ready.
5940	Understood.
5941	The adventure continues once you reach level 94.
5942	%s: %d pieces, %s: %d pieces,[ENTER]%s: %d pieces
5943	I have a guest house to run - I don't have all[ENTER]the time in the world. Bring me all the missing[ENTER]ingredients, and hurry please.
5944	You have found all the necessary ingredients for[ENTER]the Millennium Essence.
5945	Return to Octavio.
5946	Leviathan Pearls
5947	Yon-I-Walker is looking for you.
5948	I did it. I have managed to combine the most[ENTER]effective essences that are known to us with each[ENTER]other. I present to you: the Leviathan Pearls!
5949	Thank you.
5950	If you take these capsules, you might not feel[ENTER]any change. But a well-trained eye, such as mine[ENTER]or Angmur's, will be able to tell.[ENTER]Angmur wants to talk to you. Go to him now.
5951	Strengthen yourself!
5952	Swallow the Leviathan Pearls and seek out Admiral[ENTER]Angmur.
5953	Call of the Thunder Mountains
5954	Admiral Angmur has news for you.
5956	I will need a little time for the analysis of the[ENTER]samples. Come by again tomorrow and then I will[ENTER]hopefully have the results ready.
5955	Ah, the Leviathan Pearls are showing their[ENTER]effect: I can clearly see an aura of power around[ENTER]you.[ENTER]My scouts have an idea of where the headquarters[ENTER]of the Servants of Darkness might be. The place[ENTER]is heavily guarded. Could you take a look?
5957	I will report my findings to Angmur. He will then[ENTER]be in touch with you.
5958	Admiral Angmur has information on the Black Gold.[ENTER]Go to him.
5959	Aye, there you are. The analysis of the Black[ENTER]Gold is not yet complete. I hope that I will be[ENTER]able to tell you more soon. Here, take this as a[ENTER]reward for your efforts.
5960	We cannot lose any time. Quickly, bring me[ENTER]samples of the Black Gold!
5961	The adventure continues as soon as you reach[ENTER]level 95.
5962	Remaining
5963	%s: %d[ENTER]%s: %d[ENTER]%s: %d
5964	Missing amount:
5965	%s: %d
5966	Of course.
5967	Thank you. Come, I'll show you which areas you[ENTER]need to scout. Report back to me when you are[ENTER]done.
5968	
5969	Under Admiral Angmur's orders, scout out the[ENTER]Thunder Mountains. Your first target is: (%d, %d)
5970	The Thunder Mountains
5971	Scout out the Thunder Mountains and report back[ENTER]to Admiral Angmur.
5972	You haven't scouted all of the areas yet, right?[ENTER]We are dependent on this information. Please[ENTER]carry out my orders.
5973	Your first target is: %d, %d
5974	Your second target is: %d, %d
5975	
5976	Your third target is: %d, %d
5977	You have reached your first target. The next[ENTER]location is: (%d, %d)
5978	You have reached your second target. The next[ENTER]location is: (%d, %d)
5979	You have reached the third target.
5980	You were able to get an idea of the situation in[ENTER]the Thunder Mountains.[ENTER]Now report back to Admiral Angmur.
5981	Return to Admiral Angmur.
5982	Ah, you are back! Very good, we will evaluate the[ENTER]information that you have gathered and work out a[ENTER]strategy.
5983	Here is your reward.
5984	Weaken the Red Thieves
5985	Admiral Angmur is looking for you.
5986	A direct attack seems to be too risky to me at[ENTER]this time. Before we go on the offensive, we[ENTER]should weaken the enemy's troops.
5987	The following groups live in the Thunder[ENTER]Mountains: the Giants, the Cyclops and the Red[ENTER]Thieves.[ENTER]We'll attack the Red Thieves first!
5988	What weaknesses do the Red Thieves have?
5989	The Red Chief always wears a special cape, a[ENTER]symbol of strength and invincibility. Rip him out[ENTER]of this cape - that will shatter the Red Thief[ENTER]Gang's motivation!
5990	The Red Chief? That won't be an easy task...
5991	You are right. But if there is anyone that is a[ENTER]match for him, it's you. Good luck!
5992	The Red Chief
5993	Defeat the Red Chief and rip his cape from him.
5994	... failed? No, I don't believe it. Go take on[ENTER]the Red Chief again. I'm sure you'll beat him[ENTER]this time.
5995	You have defeated the Red Chief.
5996	Take his cape and bring it to Admiral Angmur.
5997	Admiral Angmur is waiting for you.
5998	The cape! I knew you would do it. We'll hang it[ENTER]up near to their camp so that they can see it –[ENTER]that'll unnerve the Red Thief Gang.[ENTER]My people will take care of it. That way you can[ENTER]recover.
5999	Weaken the Cyclops
6000	Admiral Angmur wants to talk to you.
6001	Our plan is working: when the Red Thieves saw the[ENTER]cape a great amount of disruption broke out. In[ENTER]the end, the demons and humans ended up fighting[ENTER]each other. Now this gang is completely[ENTER]disorganised.[ENTER]Next up for us are the Cyclops.
6002	How are we to proceed?
6003	The Cyclops worship their leader. If we eliminate[ENTER]the leadership squad, the Cyclops will break out[ENTER]in panic and scatter. Defeat General Outis %d[ENTER]times, Arges %d times and Polyphemos %d times.
6004	It will be a pleasure.
6005	Be careful.
6006	Fight the Cyclops!
6007	Defeat General Outis %d times, Arges %d times and[ENTER]Polyphemos %d times.
6008	I can hardly believe that you are having second[ENTER]thoughts about the Cyclops, of all creatures! Go![ENTER]I know that you can do it!
6009	You have defeated the leaders of the Cyclops.
6010	Report back to Admiral Angmur.
6011	Go to Admiral Angmur.
6012	The news of your deeds precedes you! The Cyclops[ENTER]are on the run.[ENTER]All that remain are the Giants. I will gather[ENTER]information on their weaknesses and then call for[ENTER]you.
6013	Weaken the Giants
6014	Admiral Angmur is calling for you.
6015	My scouts have uncovered the Giants' weakness.
6016	Tell me!
6017	The Giants possess a totem that has great[ENTER]spiritual value. If we take it away from them, we[ENTER]will be able to break their will.
6018	Where can I find this totem?
6019	The totem has the form of a large piece of amber.[ENTER]To protect it from thieves, it was split into %d[ENTER]parts. King Wubba and his Officers carry these[ENTER]with them.
6020	Understood.
6021	Giants' Totem
6022	Acquire all the totem pieces.
6023	The giants are very powerful opponents. But you[ENTER]have to defeat them and bring me this totem!
6024	You have gained all the totem pieces.
6025	Return to Admiral Angmur.
6026	Aye, I had started to worry! You really did it.[ENTER]Now we have the Giants' holy totems. Your reward[ENTER]for this will be great.
6027	To the Thunder Mountains
6028	Admiral Angmur is looking for you.
6029	My scouts have observed Cyclops as they gathered[ENTER]something in the Thunder Mountains and carried it[ENTER]away.
6030	Find out what the Cyclops are up to. It certainly[ENTER]can't be anything good... I doubt that they will[ENTER]give up their secret easily either.
6031	Understood.
6032	What are the Cyclops planning?
6033	Find out what the Cyclops are gathering in the[ENTER]Thunder Mountains.
6034	Find out what the Cyclops are up to. It certainly[ENTER]can't be anything good... I doubt that they will[ENTER]give up their secret easily either.
6035	You hold a shining black stone as well as a Slip[ENTER]of Paper in your hand.
6036	Show Admiral Angmur your findings.
6037	Go to Admiral Angmur.
6038	Have you found out what the Cyclops are doing in[ENTER]the Thunder Mountains?
6039	The Cyclops were not willing to talk freely, but[ENTER]in the end I was able to convince them to give me[ENTER]this: a black stone and this bit of paper.
6040	We have located the veins of Black Gold in the[ENTER]Thunder Mountains and are now mining it as you[ENTER]requested. For the handover we will meet as[ENTER]planned within the Thunder Mountains.
6041	Black Gold... That is an ore that only exists in[ENTER]the Thunder Mountains. Why do the Servants of[ENTER]Darkness need it?
6042	We need to find out what they are planning.
6043	Here it says:
6044	Black Gold
6045	Admiral Angmur would like to talk to you about[ENTER]the Black Gold.
6046	The alchemist could not analyse the Black Gold.[ENTER]The piece is too small.[ENTER]We need to find out what properties it has and[ENTER]why the Servants of Darkness are seeking it![ENTER]Could you return to the Thunder Mountains and[ENTER]secure further samples of Black Gold?
6047	Go to the alchemist first. He will tell you how[ENTER]many samples he requires.
6048	Speak with the alchemist.
6049	Greetings. Has Admiral Angmur already informed[ENTER]you about your task?
6050	Yes. How many samples of Black Gold will you need?
6051	Hmm, let me think a second. I think that %d[ENTER]samples should be enough for an analysis.
6052	Understood.
6053	The Gold of the Thunder Mountains
6054	Go to the alchemist.
6055	Search for samples of Black Gold in the Thunder[ENTER]Mountains.
6056	You have discovered a Black Gold vein and secured[ENTER]a sample of the ore for yourself.
6057	Bring it to the alchemist.
6058	Ah, you found Black Gold. Show me! Hmm, no tears[ENTER]and the piece is large enough... yes, I can use[ENTER]this for my analysis. Now I only need %d more.
6059	I cannot do anything with this sample. It is too[ENTER]light for a full analysis. Bring me another!
6060	Gold Fever
6061	Admiral Angmur is looking for you. He has new[ENTER]information on the Black Gold.
6062	The Black Gold extracts energy from creatures in[ENTER]its surroundings and releases it to another body.[ENTER]The Servants of Darkness intend to infuse Sung[ENTER]Mahi with stolen power! The Giant Captain Hooks[ENTER]hoards large supplies of Black Gold in the[ENTER]Thunder Mountains. Get them!
6063	Consider it done!
6064	
6065	
6066	On the Hook: Captain Hooks
6067	Defeat Captain Hooks of the Giants and secure the[ENTER]Black Gold!
6068	We have no time to lose. Defeat Captain Hooks and[ENTER]secure the Black Gold!
6069	There was no trace of Black Gold. Instead,[ENTER]Captain Hooks was carrying a letter on his[ENTER]person.
6070	
6071	Report back to Admiral Angmur.
6072	Aye, so you were able to hold your ground against[ENTER]Captain Hooks. What's that? A letter? Show me!
6073	
6074	Curses. Captain Hooks has already passed on the[ENTER]Black Gold to the Banshee.[ENTER]The last sentence poses a puzzle: The curse of[ENTER]life will be summoned from the fog of time by the[ENTER]army of darkness.
6075	We have to stop the delivery! We think that the[ENTER]Banshee's hideout is to the west on Gautama Cliff[ENTER]– a godless place, constantly enclosed in thick[ENTER]fog.[ENTER]Ogres and Lemures dwell there.
6076	
6077	As soon as I know which route will be used to[ENTER]bring the Black Gold to the Banshee, I'll tell[ENTER]you.
6078	Head off the Delivery
6079	Go to Admiral Angmur. He has more information on[ENTER]the delivery of the Black Gold.
6080	My scouts have found out that Captain Shruk,[ENTER]commander of the Ogres, is transporting the Black[ENTER]Gold to Gautama Cliff. He is carry it in a bag[ENTER]attached to his belt. Take it from him!
6081	
6082	Understood. I'll head out on the hunt right away.
6083	Head off the delivery!
6084	Seek out Captain Shruk and secure the bag[ENTER]containing the Black Gold before it reaches the[ENTER]Banshee.
6085	Captain Shruk is no lightweight. But you can beat[ENTER]him! Try again.
6086	You have received the bag.
6087	Return with it to Admiral Angmur.
6088	Bring your loot to Admiral Angmur.
6089	The Black Gold is in this bag? Show me! Hey?![ENTER]There's just a note here...
6090	The delivery of the Black Gold will take place[ENTER]once it has been completely processed.
6091	Curses, the Black Gold is still in the wrong[ENTER]hands. At least we now know that it has to be[ENTER]processed before the Banshee can use it for her[ENTER]purposes.
6092	It is still not too late yet. I will find out who[ENTER]is currently in possession of the Black Gold and[ENTER]whether it has already been processed. As soon as[ENTER]I find something out, I will summon you. Here,[ENTER]take this as a reward. See you soon!
6093	Stop the Processing
6094	Go to Admiral Angmur. He has news on the Black[ENTER]Gold.
6095	We have discovered that the Great Ogre is[ENTER]personally overseeing the processing of the Black[ENTER]Gold and will then take it to the Banshee.
6096	Currently he is holding up on Gautama Cliff.[ENTER]Prevent the Black Gold from reaching its goal.[ENTER]Quickly before it is too late!
6097	
6098	The Great Ogre
6099	Defeat the leader of the Ogres and stop the[ENTER]completion of the Black Gold.
6100	Every minute counts! Stop the Great Ogre!
6101	You have defeated the Great Ogre.
6102	You can't stop us! The Banshee has already[ENTER]received the Black Gold. Too late, you fools!
6103	The noose is tightening. Return to Admiral Angmur[ENTER]and give him your report.
6104	Talk to Admiral Angmur.
6105	That was fast! Do you have the Black Gold?
6106	No, I was too late. The Banshee has it already.
6107	May the Dragon God have mercy on us. But we will[ENTER]not give up so easily! I will send out my scouts[ENTER]to find out where the Banshee's whereabouts is.[ENTER]As soon as I know this, I will tell you. Take[ENTER]some time to relax and take this as a reward.
6108	Curse of Life
6109	Admiral Angmur has new information for you. Go to[ENTER]him.
6110	We now know what is meant by the curse of life[ENTER]and the army of darkness. There once lived a[ENTER]horrible mage on Dark Dragon Rock. He had[ENTER]aspirations for domination over the entire[ENTER]continent and he literally stopped at nothing to[ENTER]achieve this: using black magic, he raised the[ENTER]dead and sent them into battle as his army.
6111	
6112	Summoning the dead – even the thought of it makes[ENTER]me cringe. The Servants of the Darkness are using[ENTER]the Black Gold to create an army of the undead.[ENTER]We have to stop them!
6113	Search for the Lemures Magician in the old ruins[ENTER]at Gautama Cliff. He knows something about this[ENTER]curse. If you ask him nicely, I'm sure he'll tell[ENTER]you everything we need to know.
6114	Ask nicely... ho hum. Understood.
6115	Curse of Life
6116	Defeat the Lemures Magician and gather[ENTER]information on the curse of life and the[ENTER]summoning of the dead.
6117	We have no time to lose. Defeat the Lemures[ENTER]Magician and squeeze information on the curse of[ENTER]life out of him.
6118	You have defeated the Lemures Magician and found[ENTER]a stone tablet with an inscription.
6119	Show it to Admiral Angmur.
6120	Give Admiral Angmur your report.
6121	Aye, the Lemures Magician was carrying this stone[ENTER]tablet? Let me take a look.
6122	Three things are needed to awaken the dead:[ENTER]1. A human body[ENTER]2. ...[ENTER]The Lemures Tablet is broken here. The remaining[ENTER]part of the inscription is missing.
6123	I fear you will have to head out again. We need[ENTER]the rest of this inscription.[ENTER]There must be two more pieces of the Lemures[ENTER]Tablet.
6124	Here is your reward for everything that you have[ENTER]achieved so far. Please now head out on the hunt[ENTER]for the rest of the Lemures Tablet!
6125	The Inscription
6126	Find the Lemures Tablet!
6127	Defeat the Lemures Magician and find the[ENTER]remaining pieces of the stone tablet.
6128	Please, we need to know what this inscription[ENTER]says. Don't give up!
6129	Bring the two missing broken sections of Lemures[ENTER]Tablet to Admiral Angmur.
6130	Aye, you are back! Let's put the pieces of the[ENTER]Lemures Tablet together and read the inscription.
6131	Three things are needed to awaken the dead:[ENTER]1. A human body[ENTER]2. Black Gold[ENTER]3. Tree Demon bark[ENTER]Only a magician with outstanding skills can[ENTER]summon the curse of life and maintain it. And[ENTER]when they die, the whole undead army falls with[ENTER]them.
6132	So its for this reason that our cemeteries have[ENTER]been defiled and the corpses stolen from their[ENTER]graves. They are to be brought to life and[ENTER]marched against us as an undead army. What a[ENTER]sickening thought!
6133	We need to stop this outrageous deed!
6134	Aye, but time is working against us. Only the[ENTER]Banshee is powerful enough to summon a curse of[ENTER]this size – but we don't know where she is[ENTER]hiding.[ENTER]I will send out more men to find out the location[ENTER]of the dark high priestess. As soon as I hear[ENTER]something, I will let you know.
6135	
6136	The adventure continues as soon as you have[ENTER]reached level 96.
6137	Report back to Admiral Angmur.
6138	Remaining
6139	%s : %d
6140	Prevent the Curse
6141	Admiral Angmur would like to talk to you.
6142	Good that you are here. We have found a way to[ENTER]sabotage the plans of the Servants and the[ENTER]Banshee.
6143	
6144	
6145	So that the souls of the dead give up their[ENTER]bodies, a medium is needed. This medium is the[ENTER]Holy Ground that the Giants are storing in sacks.[ENTER]If you are able to loot 100 sacks, we will be[ENTER]able to prevent the curse of life.
6146	I'll head out immediately!
6147	Holy Ground
6148	Defeat the Giants and loot 100 sacks of Holy[ENTER]Ground.
6149	Time is working against us. Quickly, hurry and[ENTER]loot the sacks full of Holy Ground!
6150	You have looted all the sacks of Holy Ground.
6151	Bring them to Admiral Angmur.
6152	Report back to Admiral Angmur.
6153	As always, we can rely on you! Please take this[ENTER]as a reward.
6154	Prevent the Curse
6155	Admiral Angmur has a further task for you.
6156	The Ogres are also guarding a medium for the[ENTER]summoning of the dead. But we do not know what it[ENTER]looks like. Go to the Ogres and bring back[ENTER]whatever seems suspicious to you.
6157	
6158	
6159	Understood.
6160	The Ogre's Medium
6161	Defeat the Ogres and find out what form their[ENTER]medium has.
6162	I know that you do not have many clues. But[ENTER]something has to be there to find!
6163	You have found a Coin Bag and a Golden Medal.
6164	Take the items to Admiral Angmur.
6165	Report back to Admiral Angmur.
6166	Well done! I will ask Yon-I-Walker to analyse[ENTER]these items.
6167	Find Yon-I-Walker and have him tell you the[ENTER]results of his analysis.
6168	Ah there you are! I have already been able to[ENTER]take a look at the items that you found with the[ENTER]Ogres.
6169	
6170	The golden coins in the bag are releasing a[ENTER]strong dark power. They are the medium. Please[ENTER]report this to Admiral Angmur.
6171	Prevent the Curse
6172	Go to Admiral Angmur.
6173	Here, take the Gold Hunter's Band. Use it to[ENTER]locate the Ogres' Coin Bags.
6174	We need 100 Gold Coins. But I fear that not all[ENTER]of the coins that you will find will be used as a[ENTER]medium. There is a lot of work ahead of you.
6175	No problem.
6176	Hunt for Gold
6177	Go up against the Ogres in battle and collect[ENTER]Coin Bags. Not all of the coins are mediums –[ENTER]have them checked by Yon-I-Walker.
6178	Yep, I can clearly sense the dark magic here.
6179	Fantastic, we now have all the gold coins that[ENTER]could be used as a medium. That certainly won't[ENTER]please the Banshee! Here, take this as a reward.[ENTER]Angmur will issue your next task.
6180	There are still gold coins missing. Collect %d[ENTER]more.
6181	Prevent the Curse
6182	Admiral Angmur is searching for you.
6183	We need to ensure that the Servants of the[ENTER]Darkness are not able to get hold of the Tree[ENTER]Demon Bark.
6184	Tree Demons are one of the most mysterious[ENTER]species in our world and serve no one person, not[ENTER]even Sung Mahi.[ENTER]There are three types of them on Gautama Cliff:[ENTER]Aku-Boku, Arboretum and Sycomore. Pull the bark[ENTER]off of them!
6185	
6186	Understood.
6187	Pruning the Tree Demons
6188	Pull the bark off of an Aku-Boku, an Arboretum[ENTER]and a Sycomore.
6189	Remaining
6190	%s: %d[ENTER]%s: %d[ENTER]%s: %d
6191	Time is pressing. Make chippings out of the Tree[ENTER]Demons and secure their bark before the Servants[ENTER]do!
6192	You have defeated all of the Tree Demons, but[ENTER]somebody got there before you: the bark has[ENTER]already been pulled from the trunks.
6193	Report this news to Admiral Angmur.
6194	Report back to Admiral Angmur.
6195	Good to see you return unharmed! Were you[ENTER]successful? What?! The bark was already pulled[ENTER]from the Tree Demons and there were fresh signs[ENTER]of battle? The Servants of the Darkness must have[ENTER]gotten there before us.
6196	
6197	If they have the bark, then they will also find a[ENTER]way to summon the curse of life. It seems it is[ENTER]unavoidable – we are heading into war. The[ENTER]Banshee will not be able to hide from us much[ENTER]longer. My men are already on her tracks. I will[ENTER]call for you when we have found her.
6198	The adventure continues as soon as you have[ENTER]reached level 97.
6199	Remaining
6200	%s: %d pieces
6201	The gold coins serve as a medium then. Good, then[ENTER]I will seek advice from Yon-I-Walker about what[ENTER]our next move will be. I will be in touch with[ENTER]you soon.
6202	
6203	
6204	You have received a Coin Bag.
6205	Bring it to Yon-I-Walker.
6206	That is just a normal coin, not a medium. Keep[ENTER]looking!
6207	Stop the Banshee
6208	The Banshee's hideout has been discovered! Go to[ENTER]Admiral Angmur to find out more.
6209	My men have finally found the Banshee base on[ENTER]Gautama Cliff. She is holed up deep in the[ENTER]darkness of the forests in this area and is[ENTER]working on her black magic from there.[ENTER]Additionally, she has reawakened one of her[ENTER]former Dragon Cult Temple Servants. Together with[ENTER]her, she intends to summon the curse of life.
6210	Without her help, the Banshee will not be able to[ENTER]maintain the curse. Defeat the Temple Servant[ENTER]Mu-Shu and calm the souls of our comrades, before[ENTER]their bodies rise up against us.
6211	It is almost impossible to get near to the Temple[ENTER]Servant undetected in order to attack her. Use[ENTER]the moment when she is so deep in her dark magic[ENTER]that she falls into a trance!
6212	Got it.
6213	Take care! In life, she was the primary bodyguard[ENTER]for the high priestess and was well trained not[ENTER]only in magic, but also in sword combat.
6214	The Temple Servant
6215	Defeat Mu-Shu, the Banshee's Temple Servant, at[ENTER]Gautama Cliff.
6216	Killer blow struck, the Temple Servant sinks to[ENTER]the ground.
6217	You fools! You willingly took the bait that the[ENTER]Banshee set out for you. Whilst you wasted your[ENTER]time with me, the mistress and Yah-Ki, the true[ENTER]Temple Servant, have already begun the curse. I[ENTER]pray that it succeeds!
6218	A doppelgänger has thrown you off the scent![ENTER]After you search her, you find a similar necklace[ENTER]to the one on Martyaxwar. In the interior pocket[ENTER]there is a document.
6219	Report back to Admiral Angmur.
6220	You are back! Did you defeat the Temple Servant?
6221	No, we were deceived by a doppelgänger. The real[ENTER]Temple Servant was able to prepare the summoning[ENTER]of the dead in peace. Here, I found this[ENTER]document.
6222	Curses! How could we fall for her little game?![ENTER]Please, show me the document.
6223	
6224	
6225	Hmm, encrypted. But perhaps this message may[ENTER]reveal to us where her base is actually hidden. I[ENTER]have seen characters such as these once before...[ENTER]I believe that Yak-Hwan, the Palace Guard, showed[ENTER]me something similar recently. Go to him. He[ENTER]should take a look at it.
6226	Decrypt document
6227	Go to Yak-Hwan and show him the encrypted[ENTER]document.
6228	Greetings! My name is Yak-Hwan. It is an honour[ENTER]to meet you. Your deeds are already legendary![ENTER]What can I do for you? Ah, an encrypted message.[ENTER]Let me take a look.
6229	Yes, I should be able to decrypt these characters[ENTER]without a problem. Although, to be able to do so,[ENTER]I require Fossil Earth. The alchemist probably[ENTER]has a clump of it lying about. Please go and ask[ENTER]him for it.
6230	
6231	
6232	Of course.
6233	Fossil Earth
6234	Go to the alchemist and ask him about the Fossil[ENTER]Earth.
6235	Have you not forgotten something? You need to[ENTER]bring me the Fossil Earth.
6236	The alchemist has given you the Fossil Earth. Now[ENTER]return to Yak-Hwan.
6237	Ah, the Fossil Earth. Very good, I shall get to[ENTER]work. I will report what I find out to the[ENTER]Admiral.
6238	Through the back door
6239	Admiral Angmur is looking for you.
6240	We now know where the Temple Servant Yah-Ki is[ENTER]residing. But the base resembles a fortress –[ENTER]guard troops patrol there around the clock. A[ENTER]frontal attack at this time would be pure[ENTER]suicide.
6241	For this reason, we want to attack in an ambush.[ENTER]My men are searching for a suitable location.[ENTER]Distract the guards to provide us with more time.
6242	
6243	The greatest danger comes from a troop of guards[ENTER]who call themselves the Brigade of Black Death.[ENTER]This brigade consists of Moghu, Carnifex and[ENTER]General Albus. Their leader is Skeletos.[ENTER]Eliminate them, before they uncover my scouting[ENTER]troop.
6244	Understood.
6245	Brigade of Black Death
6246	Eliminate the Brigade of Black Death, comprising[ENTER]of Moghu, Carnifex, General Albus and Skeletos.
6247	Defeat the members of the Brigade of Black Death[ENTER]before they uncover the scouting troop.
6248	Report back to Admiral Angmur.
6249	Our plan is ready to go! Whilst you distracted[ENTER]the Brigade of Black Death, my men have located a[ENTER]suitable position for an ambush. As soon as our[ENTER]attack strategy is ready, I will call for you.
6250	The Temple Servant
6251	Admiral Angmur needs your help!
6252	Good, you are here. Skeletos, leader of the[ENTER]Brigade of Black Death, has survived and attacked[ENTER]my men just as they planned to storm the base.[ENTER]Nobody could get past him.
6253	
6254	You have defeated him once, please help my people[ENTER]on Gautama Cliff! Go up against Skeletos.[ENTER]Afterwards, storm the base and kill the Temple[ENTER]Servant Yah-Ki.
6255	Understood!
6256	
6257	Defeat Yah-Ki
6258	Defeat the Temple Servant Yah-Ki and stop her[ENTER]from summoning the army of the dead.
6259	The decisive day has arrived. If we fall, the[ENTER]world falls with us. But if we are victorious,[ENTER]our deeds will still be sung in songs one hundred[ENTER]years from now. Stop the Servants of Darkness.[ENTER]Defeat the Temple Servant Yah-Ki!
6260	Why are you here? The battle is not yet won![ENTER]Defeat the Temple Servant Yah-Ki. All our hopes[ENTER]rest on you.
6261	You have brought your opponent to their knees and[ENTER]victory is yours!
6262	There's no time for relaxing – the Temple Servant[ENTER]Yah-Ki is waiting for you.
6263	You have won! With a bloodcurdling scream, Yah-Ki[ENTER]sinks to the ground.
6264	Aaargh! This cannot be! Defeated by a mortal...[ENTER]oh, Banshee, forgive me! I have failed. I could[ENTER]not complete my ta...
6265	You search amongst her lifeless body and find a[ENTER]sealed letter. Return with it to Admiral Angmur.
6266	Aye, praise be to the Dragon God! You are back,[ENTER]unharmed too! Did you defeat the Temple Servant?
6267	Yes, I sent her back to the Hell that she crawled[ENTER]out from. At the point of death she begged the[ENTER]Banshee for forgiveness for her failure. She was[ENTER]carrying this.
6268	A Sealed Letter. Show me!
6269	My Mistress, They swallowed our bait whole and[ENTER]your plan is working. The summoning of your[ENTER]undead army is moving forward and nobody will be[ENTER]able to stop us now. Once the soulless bodies[ENTER]start to march, we will attack Cape Dragon Fire[ENTER]and bury its population beneath us. We will then[ENTER]head across to the mainland and meet you in[ENTER]Fireland. The world will burn under our[ENTER]footsteps![ENTER]I bow deeply to you, Your eternal servant
6270	A message to the banshee! Aye, the damnable witch[ENTER]is now waiting in vain in Fireland on her army of[ENTER]darkness.[ENTER]I thank you. Without your help, Cape Dragon Fire[ENTER]and its people would have been levelled to the[ENTER]ground by the army of the undead. You have not[ENTER]only saved us, you have also restored peace to[ENTER]the souls of our ancestors. I present this reward[ENTER]to you for all you have done.
6271	The adventure continues as soon as you have[ENTER]reached level 98.
6272	We needed a lot of time to locate the base.[ENTER]Please, we cannot lose any more time!
6273	Yak-Hwan needs Fossil Earth? It's very fortunate[ENTER]that I haven't used it all yet. Here, you're[ENTER]welcome. Now bring it to him and give him my[ENTER]warmest greetings.
6274	Remaining
6275	%s: %d[ENTER]%s: %d
6276	You have eliminated the Brigade of Black Death.
6277	Report back to Admiral Angmur.
6278	Defeat Skeletos, leader of the Brigade of Black[ENTER]Death!
6279	The Temple Servant can first be defeated for good[ENTER]once you have defeated Skeletos.
6280	Reconstructing the Fort
6281	Admiral Angmur is asking after your help. Go to[ENTER]him.
6282	Thank you for coming. The battle did not pass us[ENTER]by without leaving a trace. The fort was attacked[ENTER]too and the protective wall was torn down in many[ENTER]places. This peace will not last for long. We[ENTER]should use the calm to our benefit and rebuild.
6283	To fortify the protective wall, we need the[ENTER]armour of the crustacean tribe.
6284	Understood. How much of this armour do you need?
6285	100 of them should do it. You can still strike at[ENTER]the crustacean tribe in Nephrite Bay.
6286	Aye, that's not quite enough Crustacean Armour.[ENTER]Please gather some more.
6287	You have now gathered all the Crustacean Armour[ENTER]you require.
6288	Bring them to Admiral Angmur.
6289	Aye, very good. The Crustacean Armour will help[ENTER]us to re-fortify the protective wall. Please take[ENTER]this as a reward. I will ask my engineers whether[ENTER]they need any other materials and then let you[ENTER]know.
6290	Reconstruction of the Fort
6291	Admiral Angmur needs your help again. Go to him.
6292	To further fortify, we need Triton Spears. As the[ENTER]name suggests, you will find them amongst the[ENTER]Tritons. Please bring me 100.
6293	Understood.
6294	There you are! Aye, that isn't enough Triton[ENTER]Spears. Please keep going.
6295	You have gathered all Triton Spears
6296	Bring them to Admiral Angmur.
6297	Perfect! Now we can build a safer defensive[ENTER]fortification. I thank you for your help. By the[ENTER]way, Yak-Hwan is looking for you. Find out what[ENTER]he wants.
6298	Emergency
6299	Go to Yak-Hwan. He has an important task for you.
6300	Ah, very good, you are here! We are reliant on[ENTER]your assistance once again.
6301	
6302	
6303	
6304	The hard times of the war have not passed by the[ENTER]people that reside in the fort without a trace.[ENTER]They are suffering from starvation and their[ENTER]misery grows worse every day. Unless we do[ENTER]something soon, it does not look good for them.
6305	
6306	Gangs of ogres are ambushing our supply[ENTER]transports and attacking them. We need to stop[ENTER]this plundering. Captain Shruk and his Generals[ENTER]are behind it. Kill the captain of the ogres and[ENTER]50 General Ogg!
6307	
6308	You're back already? There are still some ogres[ENTER]about. Please take care of all of them!
6309	You have defeated all the ogres.
6310	Now return to Yak-Hwan.
6311	Finally, the food supply transports are reaching[ENTER]the fort and our people can be provided with food[ENTER]and medicines! The emergency is at an end. You[ENTER]truly are a hero.
6312	Acknowledgement
6313	Yak-Hwan wants to talk to you.
6314	Thanks to your help the danger on Dark Dragon[ENTER]Rock is banished for the time being. For this,[ENTER]the people would like to personally say thank you[ENTER]to you.
6315	Walk a tour of the fort and talk to the people.
6316	
6317	Thanks. I'll visit all of the residents.
6318	Not all of the citizens have had the chance to[ENTER]thank you. They will be most disappointed. Please[ENTER]make sure you haven't forgotten anyone.
6319	Bravery and wisdom are in your heart in equal[ENTER]measure. Your deeds will be sung generations on[ENTER]from now. I bow before you.
6320	May you be well armed against all dangers, always!
6321	You will have a place of honour in our hearts for[ENTER]all time.
6322	They were some turbulent times, right? I am sure[ENTER]that the Dragon God alone was responsible for[ENTER]paving your way to our island.
6323	You have spoken with all residents.
6324	Now return to Yak-Hwan.
6325	That truly meant something to the residents of[ENTER]the fort. The Admiral would like to talk to you[ENTER]once more. Go to him next.
6326	
6327	
6328	The Admiral's Thanks
6329	Admiral Angmur would like to express his[ENTER]gratitude to you. Go to him.
6330	Without you, the residents of this fort would[ENTER]have been overrun by demons. For your support in[ENTER]the fight against the Servants of Darkness, I[ENTER]thank you, on behalf of my troops and the entire[ENTER]people.[ENTER]On Dark Dragon Rock you will always find a place[ENTER]to call home.
6331	
6332	But the Banshee and the Servants of Darkness will[ENTER]not indulge in any form of break and will[ENTER]continue indefinitely with the forging of their[ENTER]black plans.[ENTER]The adventure continues as soon as you have[ENTER]reached level 99.
6333	
6334	Reconstruction of the Fort
6335	Fight against the Crustacean Tribe and gather 100[ENTER]pieces of Crustacean Armour.
6336	Speak with Admiral Angmur.
6337	
6338	Strengthen the defensive fortifications.
6339	Attack the Tritons and gather 100 Triton Spears.
6340	Go to Admiral Angmur.
6341	Plundering Ogres
6342	Eliminate Captain Shruk and 50 of his General[ENTER]Oggs and stop the plundering.
6343	Seek out Yak-Hwan.

12198	Reconstruction
12199	Much of the village has been badly damaged.[ENTER]I should help Confucius with the reconstruction.
12200	The village is in a terrible state, as you can[ENTER]see.[ENTER]We don't even have basic supplies.
12201	Please help us with the reconstruction.[ENTER]This is a list of the villagers who need help.[ENTER]Talk to the Storekeeper first.
12202	Talk to the Storekeeper.
12203	Help the Storekeeper with the reconstruction.
12204	I heard you want to help me. Thank you very much.
12205	I manage the stocks for the entire village.[ENTER]Drinking water, food and everything else we need.[ENTER]But the storehouse I keep all these goods in was[ENTER]destroyed.[ENTER]Will you help me to rebuild it?
12206	Yes
12207	No
12208	First, we'll need Crude Metal Sheets and Fog[ENTER]Jadite Ore.[ENTER]This'll make the storehouse as sturdy as possible.
12209	I'll clean up the remains of the old storehouse[ENTER]in the meantime.[ENTER]Please bring me %d Crude Metal Sheets and %d[ENTER]nuggets of Fog Jadite Ore.
12210	You can get Crude Metal Sheets from the monsters[ENTER]here. You can extract Fog Jadite Ore from the ore[ENTER]veins of the same name.[ENTER]I'm sure Deokbae will sell you a Pickaxe.
12211	You must still be busy. Come back again when you[ENTER]have time for me.
12212	I should obtain the materials for a new[ENTER]storehouse.
12213	The monsters nearby are carrying Crude Metal[ENTER]Sheets. Fog Jadite Ore can be extracted from the[ENTER]ore veins of the same name.
12214	Crude Metal Sheets remaining: %d

12216	We can only restock the storehouse once it has[ENTER]been repaired.[ENTER]I need Crude Metal Sheets and Fog Jadite Ore.
12217	You've collected all the required materials.[ENTER]Return to the Storekeeper.
12218	What luck! You've found everything![ENTER]I can use this to build a very stable storehouse[ENTER]that won't be so easy for the demons to destroy.[ENTER]As a token of my appreciation, you're welcome to[ENTER]use my storehouse.
12219	Your inventory is full.
12220	You have received a reward.
12221	You have rebuilt the storehouse.

12226	Please go and help the General Store Saleswoman.
12227	Go to the General Store Saleswoman.
12228	Talk to the General Store Saleswoman about her[ENTER]problem.
12229	Thanks for coming.[ENTER]I need to replenish our stocks. The monsters have[ENTER]destroyed all my items.
12230	As so much has been destroyed, it's not easy to[ENTER]find new materials to produce items.[ENTER]Could you get me the essentials?
12231	Yes
12232	No
12233	Thanks![ENTER]First, I'll brew some potions. For that I'll need[ENTER]Empty Bottles and May Bells.
12234	Please bring me some Empty Bottles and May Bells[ENTER]- I need %d of each.
12235	I'm sure you'll find some on those thieving[ENTER]demons nearby.

12247	Weapons for the Village
12248	Confucius needs your help.[ENTER]Go and see him.
12249	If we want to defend ourselves, we're going to[ENTER]need weapons.[ENTER]Please go to the Blacksmith and help him.
12250	I'm sure he'll forge weapons for you too if you[ENTER]lend him a hand.
12251	Ask the Blacksmith if he needs any help.
12252	I heard you're helping us with the reconstruction.Different materials are needed to make weapons.
12253	Unfortunately, the sea is so full of monsters[ENTER]that we cannot import materials from the old[ENTER]continent.[ENTER]Will you help me?
12254	Yes
12255	No
12256	Thanks, that gives me hope.[ENTER]I can use Jewellery Steel Sheets instead of[ENTER]quality steel.[ENTER]Troll Horns are suitable as a tempering agent.
12257	Bring me 30 Troll Horns and 30 Jewellery Steel[ENTER]Sheets.
12258	Oh, you've already got something important[ENTER]planned?[ENTER]Please come back soon.

12269	Armour for the Village
12270	The Blacksmith needs your help.[ENTER]Go and see him.
12271	Ah, it's you.[ENTER]Thanks for your help with the weapons.[ENTER]I've already equipped some adventurers with them.
12272	When heading into battle, good armour is just as[ENTER]important at a weapon.[ENTER]But the materials for armour aren't so easy to[ENTER]come by either.
12273	I need two types of steel so that the armour is[ENTER]impenetrable.[ENTER]Would you get them for me?
12274	Yes
12275	No
12276	Thank you, my friend.[ENTER]I'm sure it won't be difficult for you.
12277	Forged steel is used for the armour itself, and[ENTER]then I use jewellery steel for the outer layer.
12278	I'll need a total 30 Forged Steel Sheets and 30[ENTER]Jewellery Steel Sheets for several pieces of[ENTER]armour.
12279	I see. You have only just helped me.

12690	Forged Steel Sheets collected: %d
12288	Mysterious Illness
12289	The villagers are unusually exhausted.[ENTER]I should listen to what Confucius has to say.
12290	Thanks for your help so far.[ENTER]I have also noticed that the villagers are[ENTER]strangely worn-out and glum.[ENTER]It's as though something's draining their[ENTER]strength.
12291	Please go and ask them what they need.
12292	Ask the Weapon Shop Dealer about the mysterious[ENTER]illness.
12293	Speak to the Weapon Shop Dealer.
12294	Are you investigating whatever it is that's[ENTER]dragging us down?[ENTER]All I remember is a dark shadow in the sky...
12295	Ask the Armour Shop Dealer about the mysterious[ENTER]illness.
12296	Speak to the Armour Shop Dealer.
12297	I saw a dark shadow, yes. I've hardly slept since.But I don't want to talk about it...
12298	Ask the Blacksmith about the mysterious illness.
12299	The shadow? Yes, I know about it.[ENTER]I'd been working so hard that day.[ENTER]Then all of a sudden the ashes started falling[ENTER]from the sky.[ENTER]I was so afraid that I locked myself in my house.[ENTER]Ever since that day I've felt so... powerless.
12300	Ask the Storekeeper about the mysterious illness.
12301	The illness? I don't know whether it's an illness.But I've been terribly frightened and have been[ENTER]trembling ever since that horrible thing crossed[ENTER]the sky.
12302	I've asked all the residents.[ENTER]Confucius will certainly want to hear my report.
12303	Return to Confucius.
12304	What do the villagers say about the illness?
12305	Oh, that does not sound good at all. Supernatural[ENTER]almost.[ENTER]So everything started with the flying shadow...[ENTER]Please speak to Chaegirab. He's outside the town.
12306	I will send Chaegirab a message to let him know[ENTER]you're on your way.
12307	Here is your reward.
12308	Speak to Chaegirab about the shadow and the[ENTER]illness.
12309	Contaminated Water
12310	Go and see Chaegirab the biologist.
12311	Just look who's come to see me![ENTER]What brings you here?
12312	Ah, the mysterious illness.[ENTER]I'm researching it as we speak. You're here just[ENTER]in time.
12313	Shortly after the shadow appeared in the sky,[ENTER]I noticed a contamination nearby.
12314	Whenever it rains, a terrible stench wafts over[ENTER]here.
12315	Go to the place marked on the map and investigate[ENTER]it.
12316	Find the contaminated place and investigate it.
12317	Look closer
12318	The Tainted Flowers are giving off a revolting[ENTER]stench.[ENTER]Green slime is dripping from them.
12319	I've found a clue to the contamination.[ENTER]Now head back to Chaegirab quickly.
12320	Report back to Chaegirab about the flowers.
12321	Is that so?[ENTER]My theory is right then.[ENTER]The shadow brought the ash rain, and with the[ENTER]ashes came the contamination.
12322	The rain washes this illness into our drinking[ENTER]water...[ENTER]We need to find the source of this evil.[ENTER]Will you help me do that?
12323	Mistreated Ghosts
12324	Chaegirab is investigating the contaminated area.[ENTER]Go and see him.
12325	I need the essence of the affected ghosts from[ENTER]the area.[ENTER]Can you collect that for me?
12326	There are Mistreated Ghosts in the area who are[ENTER]suffering from the contamination.[ENTER]%d Ghost Essences should be enough.
12327	I need %d essences of Mistreated Ghosts from the[ENTER]area.
12328	Ghost Essences remaining: %d
12329	I need the essence of the Mistreated Ghosts.[ENTER]Please bring me %d.
12330	I have everything I need.[ENTER]I should go back to Chaegirab.
12331	Thank you for your help.[ENTER]There's still a lot to do. But take this for now.
12691	Ghost Essences collected: %d
12332	The Source of the Contamination
12333	Speak to Chaegirab.
12334	I trapped the Ghost Essence in the compass I gave[ENTER]you.
12335	You should be able to use it to find the source[ENTER]of the contamination.[ENTER]Use the Contamination Compass to mark your[ENTER]destination on the map.
12336	Use the Contamination Compass to find the source[ENTER]of the contamination.
12337	Use the Contamination Compass to find the source[ENTER]of the contamination.[ENTER]The destination is marked on the map.
12338	I've found the source of the contamination.[ENTER]I should check it out.
12339	So this is the root of the evil.[ENTER]I should report back to Chaegirab about this.
12340	I should report back to Chaegirab about this.
12341	Did it work? Just as expected.[ENTER]Please speak to Confucius while I analyse the[ENTER]data.
12342	Report on the Contamination
12343	I've found the source of the contamination.[ENTER]I should talk to Confucius.
12344	Is that so? I did not know that.[ENTER]What are we going to do?
12345	I think this place needs to be destroyed.[ENTER]When you are ready, please head there and deal[ENTER]with it.[ENTER]I will send someone to help you.
12346	I should go to the contaminated area and destroy[ENTER]the source.
12347	Go to the dispatched commander in the[ENTER]contaminated area.
12348	Ah, it's you.[ENTER]I came here immediately when Confucius told me[ENTER]about you.[ENTER]Take this.
12349	Soul Stones
12350	Find the dispatched commander in the contaminated[ENTER]area.
12351	I want to purify this stinking, dangerous place,[ENTER]but there is still so much to research here. I'm[ENTER]counting on you.
12352	I have good news from Chaegirab: Purified Cores[ENTER]of certain souls can stop the contamination.[ENTER]Collect these cores of ghosts on your way.
12353	Hunt the monsters nearby for Purified Cores.
12354	Collect %d Purified Cores
12355	Purified Cores remaining: %d
12356	Please stop this illness.[ENTER]You need %d Purified Cores to do so.
12357	You have gathered all %d Purified Cores.[ENTER]Return to the dispatched commander.
12358	You've done well.
12359	Take the cores to Chaegirab.[ENTER]He knows what to do with them.
12360	Here, take this here as a reward.
12692	Purified Cores gathered: %d
12361	Purification
12362	I should talk to Chaegirab about the[ENTER]contamination.
12363	Oh, you're back. Very good. These cores will be[ENTER]plenty.[ENTER]However, there's something else we'll need for a[ENTER]successful purification.
12364	There's a dangerous cave nearby. A real labyrinth[ENTER]inhabited by evil creatures called gnolls.
12365	A rare plant known as Shadowfern grows in the[ENTER]cave.[ENTER]Together with the cores, I think they should be[ENTER]able to purify the contamination.[ENTER]Could you fetch some of them for me?
12366	Yes
12367	No
12368	You are so brave, I'm almost a little envious![ENTER]Shadowfern grows deep in the cave, in a secret[ENTER]chamber guarded by the Gnoll Master.[ENTER]Defeat him and bring the plant to me.
12369	I should defeat the Gnoll Master in the gnoll[ENTER]caves.
12370	I know it's dangerous, but please reconsider.
12371	Find the way through the gnoll caves and retrieve[ENTER]the Shadowfern from the Gnoll Master.
12372	You have found my secret chamber and defeated[ENTER]me... take the Shadowfern in recognition of this!
12373	I've found the Shadowfern.[ENTER]Now head back to Chaegirab quickly.
12374	I have the key to the purification of the[ENTER]contamination![ENTER]Now head back to Chaegirab quickly.
12375	You did it![ENTER]That's the secret plant we need!
12376	That should be enough to stop the contamination.[ENTER]Give me some time to prepare everything.
12377	Gnolls in the Village
12378	Confucius wants to talk to you.[ENTER]Go and see him.
12379	Glad you're here![ENTER]Ever since you went to the gnoll caves, the[ENTER]village has been under constant attack.
12380	Barely anyone dares to leave their homes because[ENTER]those monsters are skulking around the place.[ENTER]Someone's even been injured already.[ENTER]We need to drive them back into their caves.
12381	Can you teach the gnolls a lesson?
12382	Yes
12383	No
12384	Fantastic! I'm sure they won't bother us any more[ENTER]if you take care of them.
12385	Kill %d Monsters in the Gnoll Caves
12386	Monsters remaining
12387	I was wrong about you...
12388	The village is in danger.[ENTER]Teach the monsters in the gnoll caves a lesson!
12389	Monsters remaining: %d
12390	I'm scared that the monsters will attack us again.
12391	I've killed %d monsters.[ENTER]Now head back to Confucius quickly!
12392	Good work! The area might still be in danger, but[ENTER]the monsters from the caves are leaving us alone[ENTER]now at least.[ENTER]I will post more guards to secure the village.
12393	You have received %d Thief's Gloves.
12394	Water Treatment
12395	Chaegirab has finished his research into the[ENTER]purification of the contamination.[ENTER]Speak to Chaegirab.
12396	It took a while, but we are finally ready now![ENTER]I have made a purifying nectar from the[ENTER]Shadowfern and the cores.
12397	With it, you can rid our drinking water of the[ENTER]contamination.[ENTER]Pour the nectar into the waterfall. It will be[ENTER]dispersed well from there.
12398	Speak to my little brother there, Kim Rim. He is[ENTER]watching over the waterfall for us.[ENTER]I've marked his location on the map.
12399	I should speak to Chaegirab's brother, Kim Rim.
12400	Take Chaegirab's Fern Nectar to the destination[ENTER]on the map.
12401	Nice to meet you at long last. I have heard so[ENTER]much about you![ENTER]This is the main water supply for our village.
12402	Once the water has been purified, the symptoms of[ENTER]the illness should abate. You should pour the[ENTER]nectar into the water there so that it is[ENTER]dispersed well.
12403	Take Chaegirab's Fern Nectar to the destination[ENTER]marked on the map.
12404	Take the Fern Nectar to the destination marked on[ENTER]the map.
12405	Couldn't you find the right place? You have to go[ENTER]right to the very top where the water starts to[ENTER]fall.
12406	I'm in the right place.[ENTER]I'll pour the Fern Nectar into the water.
12407	I've done it! Now head back to Chaegirab quickly.
12408	Now head back to Chaegirab quickly.
12409	Did you purify the water? Excellent.[ENTER]Now we'll just have to wait and see if my[ENTER]calculations were correct.
12410	It's too early to celebrate, but you've done a[ENTER]brave job.
12411	You have received %d blessings.
12412	A Celebration
12413	Report to Confucius about your deeds.
12414	The nectar worked![ENTER]The villagers are all doing much better now.[ENTER]Just look: everyone's well and no one's showing[ENTER]any more symptoms.
12415	You have done us a great service.[ENTER]Please celebrate with us!
12416	Speak to the villagers and return to Confucius.
12417	The Weapon Shop Dealer looks happy. I should talk[ENTER]to him.
12418	I feel so much better. It's as though my fear has[ENTER]been blown away. Thank you very much!
12419	You have received %d Stones of the Blacksmith.
12420	Business is booming now that everyone is able to[ENTER]go back to work. And it's all thanks to you!
12421	Here's our hero![ENTER]I can finally sleep soundly again. You deserve a[ENTER]reward. I've given Chaegirab a little something[ENTER]for you.
12422	I've spoken to everyone.[ENTER]Chaegirab has a reward for me.
12423	The villagers always make a celebration out of[ENTER]everything... but they're right.[ENTER]You've done well.[ENTER]You receive Sung Ma's will (STR) +%d.
12706	Go to the General Store Saleswoman to celebrate[ENTER]the day.
12707	You have received %d Sun Elixirs (S).
12708	Go to the Armour Shop Dealer to celebrate the day.
12709	You have received %d Ritual Stones.
12971	A Hidden Valley
12972	There are rumours that a new valley has been[ENTER]found. Go to Confucius.
12973	I haven't seen you for a while. Where have you[ENTER]been all this time? The secret place that gave[ENTER]you such a headache before has been found.
12974	I've heard that the way there is winding and[ENTER]treacherous. I'd like to ask you to go there and[ENTER]find out more about this hidden valley. As soon[ENTER]as you arrive, you will meet a guardian who I[ENTER]sent there a while ago.
12975	A new area has been unlocked. Head to the Serpent[ENTER]Guardian.
12976	Hey, what are you doing standing around here? If[ENTER]you go to the Dong Gwang Plain, you can get to[ENTER]the new area from there.
12977	Go to the new area and meet with the Serpent[ENTER]Guardian.
12978	Who are you then? Hah, did Confucius send you?[ENTER]You cannot be serious... Why has he sent a newbie[ENTER]like you to a land as tough as this?
12979	Confucius told me to give you this when you[ENTER]arrived. Come back again later. You still have[ENTER]tasks to do.
6353	A Life Reborn
6354	You awake and find yourself feeling unusually[ENTER]furry. What happened? Where are you?! Look for[ENTER]Myonghorang the Wise. He will be able to explain.
6355	Welcome Lycan!
6356	Ah, you're awake! Good. How do you feel? Still a[ENTER]bit weak-kneed? That will soon pass.[ENTER]Are you wondering what happened? You've been[ENTER]bitten by an infected wolf. My friend, you have[ENTER]metamorphosed.[ENTER]Oh yes, it's incurable - and no, it's not a[ENTER]disease! It's irrelevant now who you once were.[ENTER]Henceforth you will be one of us: a Lycan![ENTER]Soon you will feel how the power of the wolves[ENTER]courses through your veins! Your mind and your[ENTER]senses will become sharper than ever before!
6357	Frenzied Beasts
6358	The Colony Guard reported that the wild animals[ENTER]have been acting very strangely of late. Go to[ENTER]him and find out more!
6359	Ah, a newcomer. Welcome! Good that you're here. I[ENTER]could really use your help. By all rights we[ENTER]share a deep friendship with the wild animals -[ENTER]but recently things have been out of kilter.[ENTER]They're attacking us, wanting to kill us. Please,[ENTER]find out what the cause of this behaviour could[ENTER]be.
6360	Investigate the Wild Animals
6361	Go on the hunt and find the cause of the wild[ENTER]animals' aggressive behaviour.
6362	I don't have anything new to tell you just now.[ENTER]Please go and find out what's driving the wild[ENTER]animals into a frenzy.
6363	Unknown Stone
6364	I've never seen a stone like this around here[ENTER]before. There's a curious darkness emanating from[ENTER]it! Find some more stone samples so that we can[ENTER]examine them further.
6365	I have nothing more to report to you. Head out[ENTER]and find some more stone samples for me!
6366	Good, these stone samples should suffice.[ENTER]Myonghorang the Wise will analyse them. Go to him[ENTER]to find out more.
6367	Collect Unknown Stones and bring them to the[ENTER]Colony Guard. Number of stone samples: %d
6368	You've collected enough stone samples. Return to[ENTER]the Colony Guard.
6369	%s: %d remaining
6370	Source of the Evil
6371	So, you discovered this mysterious stone? I knew[ENTER]you'd be the right person for the task. Although[ENTER]the fragments are only small, they emit a[ENTER]powerful, evil aura. It would certainly be a[ENTER]major coincidence if they had nothing to do with[ENTER]the curious goings-on around here.
6372	Could you carry out some further investigations?[ENTER]Go to the Portal Guard. He has a job for you.
6373	Traces of Evil
6374	The bears are completely out of control! Go on[ENTER]the hunt and find out what has driven them into a[ENTER]rage!
6375	Well done! Here's your well-earned reward.
6376	Hunt bears and find out what has made them so[ENTER]aggressive.
6377	Did you manage? Well done! Here, take this by way[ENTER]of reward.
6378	Your mission was successful. Return to the Portal[ENTER]Guard.
6379	Portal Guard
6380	A patrol saw some kind of meteorite falling from[ENTER]the heavens. Look for the impact site. Meanwhile,[ENTER]I'll report back to Myonghorang. Please destroy[ENTER]the following number: %d. Bring some pieces back[ENTER]so we can conduct an analysis.
6381	Meteorite Hunt
6382	Find the meteorite impact site and destroy it.[ENTER]Bring back fragments for analysis.
6383	We need to make sure all of them have been[ENTER]destroyed. Bring back %d as proof.
6384	We need some more pieces of this demonic[ENTER]meteorite. Collect the following number: %d.[ENTER]Bring the samples to Myonghorang.
6385	You were successful. Return to Myonghorang.
6386	%s: %d remaining
6387	Very good! You've proved you can protect your[ENTER]tribe from the imminent dangers! Maybe we can[ENTER]keep them at bay this way. I've already told[ENTER]Myonghorang of your deeds. Why not head over to[ENTER]him now? He has some more information for you[ENTER]about these demonic rocks.
6388	The Metin Stone
6389	The Metin Stone
6390	The Metin Stone
6391	Tidings of your great deeds precede you. The[ENTER]nefarious energy poisoning our air has already[ENTER]weakened. I've analysed the stone fragments you[ENTER]gathered. They are conclusively the source of[ENTER]this dark energy. These meteorites must be the[ENTER]same mysterious Metin stones that plunged the[ENTER]world of humans into chaos. I will continue with[ENTER]my investigations. In the meantime, destroy the[ENTER]following number of Metin stones: %d
6392	Destroy more Metin stones!
6393	You should head off immediately and destroy the[ENTER]following number of Metin stones: %d.
6394	You have completed your mission. Return to[ENTER]Myonghorang.
6395	%s: %d remaining
6396	You're back! Well done! Here's your well-deserved[ENTER]reward.
6397	Sung Mahi
6398	I wrote a letter about these events to my friend[ENTER]Uriel, one of the humans' scholars. His reply was[ENTER]very insightful. The source of this evil is[ENTER]called Sung Mahi. He is the god of all demons and[ENTER]has sent the Metin stones to plunge the continent[ENTER]into chaos and destroy all life on it. We must[ENTER]join the humans in their fight against this[ENTER]ominous darkness - or perish with them.
6399	Talk to Myonghorang
6400	Myonghorang the Wise has a job for you.
6401	Kingdom of Humans
6402	Until now our species has always kept out of the[ENTER]world's conflicts. But if we stood idly by this[ENTER]time, we would be hastening our own demise. Visit[ENTER]the kingdom of the humans and find my friend[ENTER]Uriel. He will be able to help you further. Talk[ENTER]to the Portal Guard. He will guide you. Good luck[ENTER]and god speed...
6403	Find Uriel
6404	Your journey has brought you to the world of[ENTER]humans. You should now search for Uriel.
6405	A Lycan! Welcome to the world of humans. Thank[ENTER]goodness Myonghorang is always sending his[ENTER]support; alone we would be lost. Metin stones are[ENTER]raining from the heavens, demons are flooding[ENTER]into our world... it is a nightmare. Only if we[ENTER]combine our efforts will we be able to banish[ENTER]this danger which threatens to consume us all.[ENTER]Join the forces for good and help us to defeat[ENTER]this evil once and for all!
6406	You were successful. Return to Myonghorang.
6407	Go and talk to the Colony Guard.
6408	Go to Myonghorang.
6409	Go to the Colony Guard.
6410	Go to the Portal Guard. You'll find him at the[ENTER]edge of the colony.
6411	Bear Hunt

6413	Remaining
6414	You can teleport to the first human village once[ENTER]you have reached level %d.
6415	Leave Lycan colony
6416	The fish farm
6417	Fisherman:
6418	I would like to expand my fish farm. This is why[ENTER]I need living Carps. These fish are very good for[ENTER]breeding and are very popular amongst Fishermen.[ENTER]Unfortunately they're not very easy to catch.
6419	If you bring me a Carp, I'll give you a reward.[ENTER]I have a chest in my attic that has been there[ENTER]for ages. I can't even remember what is in there.[ENTER]It might be something completely useless or[ENTER]something really valuable. However, monsters[ENTER]might also be hiding in there. If you want it,[ENTER]bring me a living Carp.
6420	Exchange Carp for Chest
6421	You are bringing me a carp for my fish farm?[ENTER]Thank you! Here is the promised chest. Good luck!
6422	You have received a Chest![ENTER]Right-click to open it.
6424	Hurry up and tell me where you would like to be[ENTER]teleported to. I'm tired.
6425	Spider Dungeon 1
6423	I want to travel.
6427	It costs %s Yang, but I'm going to increase the[ENTER]price if you carry on like this.
6426	County Jungrang
6429	But I am going to increase the price if you carry[ENTER]on like this!
6428	County Waryong
6431	Like I said: You can only teleport to this place[ENTER]when you have reached level 60. Do you still want[ENTER]to teleport? If not, then close the window. And[ENTER]stop changing your mind. I'm not standing around[ENTER]here for fun.
6430	County Imha
6433	Anyway, it costs %s Yang.
6432	Castle Milaard
6435	I could teleport you for free, but I have a big[ENTER]family. I need to keep them fed, so I have to[ENTER]earn money.
6434	Castle Listhmos
6437	It costs %s Yang.
6436	Castle Dendera
6439	Now, I'm going to teleport you immediately. You[ENTER]will be going to a dangerous place, so be[ENTER]careful. Good luck!

6452	As you wish... See you soon!
6453	Dark Dragon Rock
6454	Recently a mysterious island has been discovered.[ENTER]It has been named Dark Dragon Rock. Those that[ENTER]wish to survive there need to have quite a bit of[ENTER]experience. For this reason, I will only take[ENTER]warriors who have reached level 90. Are you ready[ENTER]to undertake this journey?
6455	You can only get to the island by ship – and the[ENTER]journey there is long and arduous. The higher[ENTER]your level, the more demanding the transport. For[ENTER]this reason, I have to ask for a higher fee from[ENTER]you.
6456	This journey costs you %d Yang.
6457	Map information
6459	Map Name: %s[ENTER]Level: %d[ENTER]Amount: %d
6460	Cape Dragon Fire
6461	Gautama Cliff
6462	Nephrite Bay
6463	Thunder Mountains
6458	This is a fascinating place. But does anything[ENTER]out of the ordinary ever happen here? Probably[ENTER]not. In other parts of the country, everything[ENTER]looks a little different! I'm sure there's[ENTER]somewhere interesting that I could teleport you[ENTER]to. As the powers of evil have got stronger[ENTER]again, time and space has been thrown into chaos.[ENTER]Your return might not always work. Do you want to[ENTER]be teleported anyway?
6464	Do you want to teleport?
6465	You cannot be teleported.
6466	Your level is too low.

6476	Where do you want to teleport to?
6477	This costs %s Yang.
6478	Snakefield

6493	List of wedding ceremonies
6492	Tuxedo
6494	There are no weddings being held at the moment.
6495	The wedding of %s and %s
6496	You are a wedding guest! Have fun.
6497	The ink hasn't even dried yet! Give yourself more[ENTER]time.
6498	You or your partner has no Engagement Ring.
6491	I want to get married.
6499	If you want to get married, you need to wear a[ENTER]Tuxedo.
6500	Wedding Dress
6501	If you want to get married, you need to wear a[ENTER]Wedding Dress.
6502	Love alone cannot help you to arrange a wedding,[ENTER]you need some Yang for that. Unfortunately you do[ENTER]not have enough money at the moment. When you[ENTER]have saved a million Yang, I would be happy to[ENTER]plan you ceremony.
6503	You need to have 1 million Yang.
6504	You are mature enough now and you also look[ENTER]determined. Whom do you want to marry?
6505	Please enter the name of the person whom you wish[ENTER]to marry.
6506	Are you so excited that you can't even write down[ENTER]the name? Try again.
6507	So you don't know the name of the person you want[ENTER]to marry? Are you really sure you want to get[ENTER]married?
6509	%s is not online
6508	Another wedding is taking place right now. Please[ENTER]wait a moment, or come back later!
6510	Your partner needs to be close so that I can[ENTER]conduct the ceremony. Please bring your partner[ENTER]here. 
6511	%s is too far away.
6512	Not your name, but your partner's name.
6513	Enter your partner's name here.
6514	I'm sorry, but you can't marry a person of the[ENTER]same sex.
6515	Only people from the same kingdom can marry.
6516	The person you want to marry is already married.[ENTER]Didn't you know that? You need to find someone[ENTER]who's single.
6517	%s is married.
6518	This person is not mature enough for a marriage.[ENTER]Your partner needs to be at least at level 25,[ENTER]too.
6520	I'm sorry, but I cannot wed the two of you. You[ENTER]don't make a good couple because your experience[ENTER]difference is larger than 15 levels.
6519	Aren't you are too young to get married? You need[ENTER]a lot of responsibility for married life and you[ENTER]don't seem mature enough yet. Young people get[ENTER]divorced very quickly, so I'm afraid I'm not[ENTER]going to authorise this. Get some more experience[ENTER]first.
6521	Now, you may exchange rings.
6522	A wedding is a very important step in one's life.[ENTER]Couldn't your partner at least have brought a[ENTER]Wedding Ring?
6523	Your partner needs to have a Wedding Ring, too.
6524	Your partner isn't wearing any wedding clothes.[ENTER]Aren't you embarrassed?
6525	Your partner needs to wear a Tuxedo.
6526	Your partner needs to wear a Wedding Dress.
6527	%s has proposed to you. Would you like to accept?
6528	So this is it: The two of you have decided to be[ENTER]joined in holy matrimony and can now spend some[ENTER]time together. I am going to send you to Lovers'[ENTER]Island. I wish you both a long and happy[ENTER]marriage. Congratulations.[ENTER][ENTER]Shortly you will automatically be sent to Lovers'[ENTER]Island.
6529	Your partner does not seem to want to marry you.[ENTER]Perhaps you should sort that out.
6530	Return to the wedding room
6532	Why are you still here? Your partner is already[ENTER]waiting for you. You should go there immediately.
6531	Information:
6533	Wedding Permit
6534	Wedding Planner:
6535	I'm talking to your partner. One moment, please.

6537	This name is not registered. Please check your[ENTER]information.
6538	Please bring your partner here. I need to talk to[ENTER]your partner to clarify a few things.
6539	%s is still too far away.
6540	You have to write down the name of your partner,[ENTER]not your own name.
6541	Wedding Planner:
6543	Something's wrong, this isn't the person I was[ENTER]expecting.
6542	Marriage is only possible once level 25 has been[ENTER]reached.
6544	Your partner does not seem to be ready for the[ENTER]wedding yet. Sort it out amongst yourselves.
6545	Now that everything is prepared, the ceremony can[ENTER]begin!
6546	It will be a really nice wedding!

6552	Please wait a moment, I'm talking to your partner[ENTER]at the moment.
6554	Do you want to continue with the wedding?
6553	You want to marry without a Ring?
6555	Yes
6556	No
6557	Your partner needs to agree with the cancellation[ENTER]of the wedding. It cannot be cancelled now as you[ENTER]partner is not online.
6558	The ceremony cannot be performed until we have[ENTER]received affirmation from your partner. Have a[ENTER]little patience.
6559	Do you want to end this wedding?
6560	Your partner does not want to.
6561	Divorce
6562	Divorce
6563	You can't get divorced in the absence of your[ENTER]partner. You have to come back here together one[ENTER]more time first.
6565	For a legal divorce, you need 500,000 Yang and[ENTER]your partner's agreement. Do you really want to[ENTER]get divorced?

6566	Nah, just kidding.

6568	Your partner also needs to have the ring here.

6570	To get divorced, you need %s Yang.
6571	You need 500,000 Yang for a divorce.

6573	No. I have changed my mind.
6574	I have changed my mind. I don't want to get[ENTER]divorced.
6576	It's better this way. I hope you have a long and[ENTER]fulfilled life.
6575	You have to get an Engagement Ring first. Then[ENTER]you can marry.
6577	You are now divorced.
6578	Do you agree to the divorce?
6579	The divorce has been carried out.[ENTER]You are now divorced.
6580	Your documents are not complete. Please come[ENTER]again later.

6583	Remove Wedding Ring
6584	Remove Wedding Ring 
6585	You should forget bad memories as quickly as[ENTER]possible.
6586	The Wedding Ring has been removed.
6588	One-sided divorce
6587	Do you really want to marry like this? You only[ENTER]get married once in a lifetime, so you should[ENTER]think about dressing appropriately.
6589	Guardian:
6590	You need 1 million Yang for a one-sided divorce.[ENTER]Do you still want to get divorced?
6591	No, I just wanted to know.
6592	You don't have enough Yang for the divorce. You[ENTER]need as much Yang for it as you paid for your[ENTER]wedding.
6593	Are you sure that you want to get divorced?
6594	I do.
6595	I should reconsider.
6596	Well, it's probably better this way. You can come[ENTER]back again once you're sure that you really want[ENTER]it.
6597	As you are sure about this, I'm going to go ahead[ENTER]with the divorce. I wish you both all the best[ENTER]for the future.
12593	Gnoll Caves
12594	I'm keeping the villagers away from the caves.[ENTER]It's dangerous in there.[ENTER]But if you have a Passage Ticket, you're probably[ENTER]strong enough to survive in there.[ENTER]Do you really want to go inside?
12595	Of course
12596	I'd rather not
12597	You need a Passage Ticket.
12598	Do you want to leave the dungeon?
12599	Do you want to move deeper into the caves?[ENTER]Once you reach Level 2, you will no longer be[ENTER]able to return to Level 1.

6673	Do you want to improve your Pickaxe? Let's see...[ENTER]The current level of your Pickaxe is %s.
6674	Do you want to improve it?
6675	The improvement of your Pickaxe has a %s percent[ENTER]chance of failing. In this case your Pickaxe's[ENTER]points will be reduced.[ENTER]Do you want to try anyway?
6676	It's your decision. If I should improve the[ENTER]pickaxe then come back later. See you!
6677	Sorry, there was a problem with the improvement.[ENTER]I couldn't do anything. Here, take it back and[ENTER]try again later.
6678	Here is your Pickaxe with a new level!
6679	Oh no, I made a mistake! I'm sorry.[ENTER]Unfortunately, your Pickaxe's points have[ENTER]dropped.

12647	Congratulations! The refinement was successful.
12648	Oh no! The refinement failed.
12524	All the shops are closed due to the damage.
12525	Where are the horses?
12526	Our village was devastated. I was protecting the[ENTER]stables... and lost everything. But I'll help you[ENTER]as much as I can. I won't let a little monster[ENTER]attack like that get me down!
6692	Ho ho ho!
6693	Ah, it's you![ENTER]We haven't seen one another for quite a while.[ENTER]Another year has already come and gone, ho ho![ENTER]Perhaps you are asking yourself why I'm back here[ENTER]in the village.[ENTER]Allow me to explain...
6694	Times are hard. Nobody wants to buy books or[ENTER]other such things these days.[ENTER]With my age creeping on, it's too tiresome to be[ENTER]flying around on a reindeer-led sledge.[ENTER]So, with that in mind, I have decided to[ENTER]celebrate Christmas this year in the village.
6695	If you've got any more questions, you can always[ENTER]come and ask me. Happy Christmas!
6696	Would you like some mulled wine?
6697	Ho ho ho! I'm certain you know what that is,[ENTER]right? There's no better drink for wintry times![ENTER]You mix a fine wine, a pinch of cinnamon and a[ENTER]bunch of cloves... mmmmm!
6698	In this cold weather, a sip of mulled wine will[ENTER]do you the world of good! It gives you strength[ENTER]and helps you to move faster.[ENTER]Would you like to try some?[ENTER]Very well, one coming right up!
6699	It seems you like the taste of mulled wine ho ho![ENTER]Do you feel it warming you from the inside?[ENTER]Oh and the taste, so sweet and fruity![ENTER]Merry Christmas!
6700	More mulled wine please!
6701	Hang on a second![ENTER]I forgot one small detail![ENTER]I can only prepare mulled wine for you once a[ENTER]day, I don't have enough ingredients to make[ENTER]more. And it only lasts for 20 hours. In one[ENTER]bottle there are 6 portions, the effects of a sip[ENTER]last for 30 minutes. Portion them out wisely!
6702	You're welcome! You've had to wait long enough.[ENTER]This wonderful drink will give you wings, ho ho[ENTER]ho! So, I hope you enjoy it. Merry Christmas!
6703	What, you want some more?[ENTER]Sorry, but I think you've had enough. 24 hours[ENTER]have not passed since your last ration of mulled[ENTER]wine. Too much of this stuff isn't good for you,[ENTER]you know! Come back again later.[ENTER]Until then, enjoy the festivities!

6706	What's with the stockings?
6707	The stockings! I almost forgot about them![ENTER]I wanted to hide my presents in the stockings[ENTER]hanging over the fireplace. However these[ENTER]un-Christmassy creatures have stolen them all![ENTER]Help me to get them back.
6708	Stockings aren't so easy to find. You will need[ENTER]the Reindeer Calf to be able to sniff them out.
6709	Isn't it cute?[ENTER]It also has an excellent sense of smell. A[ENTER]specialist in stocking hunting![ENTER]It stays with you for 2 hours and helps you in[ENTER]the search. Afterwards it will get tired and need[ENTER]24 hours' rest before it can continue.[ENTER]If you don't want to wait so long, then take a[ENTER]look down to the left at what's behind the[ENTER]spinning coin, I've heard that another Reindeer[ENTER]Calf is waiting there. But I'll also be glad to[ENTER]see you if you visit me again tomorrow!
6710	I'm bringing you stockings!
6711	Bring me at least 5 Stockings and you will[ENTER]receive a reward.[ENTER]Urrgh, the scent of musty Stockings is[ENTER]unbearable! Come back when you have collected[ENTER]enough. Happy Christmas!
6712	Ho ho ho, you've gathered enough Stockings.[ENTER]Hmm, let me see.[ENTER]URRGH this smell! Well, they are definitely the[ENTER]right ones![ENTER]Merry Christmas!
6713	Reindeer Calf
6714	You have already received a Reindeer Calf Seal[ENTER]from me today. I'm afraid the little guy needs a[ENTER]rest now. It'll be back to full fitness tomorrow.[ENTER]If you don't want to wait so long, then take a[ENTER]look down to the left at what's behind the[ENTER]spinning coin, I've heard that another Reindeer[ENTER]Calf is waiting there. But I'll also be glad to[ENTER]see you if you visit me again tomorrow!
6715	You already brought me your stockings today.[ENTER]Remember, you can only hand some over every 24[ENTER]hours.

6717	Wonda-Rim:
6718	The gift for Chaegirab
6719	My uncle Chaegirab has dedicated his life to[ENTER]science and has invested all his Yang into his[ENTER]research. He's always been good to me, so I would[ENTER]like to surprise him with a gift. Would you go to[ENTER]Uriel and ask him whether he has an idea of what[ENTER]I could give him? He's my uncle's old teacher and[ENTER]he knows him very well.
6720	But don't tell my uncle about it!
6721	Will you help me?
6722	Uriel:
6723	Speak to Uriel
6724	Uriel
6725	Talk to Uriel about his former pupil Chaegirab.
6726	Uriel is in %s.
6727	Wonda-Rim wants to give Chaegirab a gift...
6728	A scientist's pleasure in life comes from[ENTER]research. It's that simple. The best way to[ENTER]please Chaegirab is to support his work. The[ENTER]Mu-Rang Wolf is a rare visitor to these lands,[ENTER]but its fur is also a rare treat for every[ENTER]biologist. Five pieces of fur should be enough.[ENTER]So you can tell Wonda-Rim that.
6729	I'm sure this impressive fur would impress the[ENTER]biologist.
6730	Yes, I'll let him know.
6731	Back to Wonda-Rim
6732	Uriel thought of a great gift for Chaegirab. Go[ENTER]back to Wonda-Rim and tell him about it.
6733	Wonda-Rim is in %s.
6734	Uriel's suggestion sounds good. As I really want[ENTER]to make this a surprise for my Uncle Chaegirab, I[ENTER]have to get hold of this fur. Could you go out[ENTER]and kill 5 Mu-Rangs for me?
6735	I'm supposed to kill Mu-Rang-Wolves to get their[ENTER]fur.
6736	5 are enough for a good gift.
6737	Let's go!
6738	You have looted some good quality fur.
6739	Hunt Mu-Rang Wolves and loot their fur.
6740	You have collected %s of 5 pieces of fur.
6741	Fur for Wonda-Rim
6742	You have looted enough fur, now take it to[ENTER]Wonda-Rim.
6743	You have already collected %s pieces of wolf fur.
6744	This is really nice fur, thank you. Could you[ENTER]take it to my uncle?
6745	Uncle Chaegirab
6746	Wonda-Rim has asked you to take the Wolf Fur to[ENTER]Chaegirab.
6747	Chaegirab is in %s.
6748	Aha. So that what he's trying to do now.
6749	From whom is this fur? It's from Wonda-Rim, but[ENTER]you killed the wolves for him?[ENTER]I'm embarrassed to have a nephew that makes[ENTER]others do work for him. So, I'm sorry, but I[ENTER]can't accept this, even though I know you went to[ENTER]a lot of time and effort.
6750	Tell Wonda-Rim that I've seen right through him![ENTER]If he really wants treat me to something, he[ENTER]should go hunting himself.
6751	Chaegirab didn't accept the fur and is angry at[ENTER]Wonda-Rim for his laziness. He has sent you back[ENTER]to Wonda-Rim.
6752	What did my uncle say? I hope he liked my gift?
6753	Yes, he was thrilled.
6754	No, not at all.
6755	Great! I love giving other people a treat. And of[ENTER]course I will give you a generous reward. Here,[ENTER]take this!
6756	You have received 20,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 20,000 Yang.[ENTER]You have received a Lump of Gold.
6757	You lied to Wonda-Rim and have lost good/evil[ENTER]points.
6758	He didn't accept the fur? Hmm, maybe it wasn't[ENTER]such a good idea to send you hunting instead of[ENTER]me. I'll do it differently next time.
6759	But I don't want all your hard work to be for[ENTER]nothing: Go to Yang-Shin. He'll buy the fur off[ENTER]you for a good price.
6760	What a disappointing turn of events. Well, at[ENTER]least you still have the fur. Go to the hunter[ENTER]Yang-Shin in Yayang and sell the fur to him.
6761	What a disappointing turn of events. Well, at[ENTER]least you still have the fur. Go to the hunter[ENTER]Yang-Shin in Bokjung and sell the fur to him.
6762	What a disappointing turn of events. Well, at[ENTER]least you still have the fur. Go to the hunter[ENTER]Yang-Shin in Bakra and sell the fur to him.
6763	Mu-Rang Fur? That'll come in very handy. I'll[ENTER]make myself some underwear with it. Here's a bag[ENTER]of Yang for your efforts. Oh, and I found this[ENTER]book yesterday, maybe you can find a use for it.
6764	You have received 40,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 10,000 Yang.[ENTER]You have received a Skill Book.
6765	Yang-Shin
6766	Yang-Shin:
6767	Guardian
6768	The Guardian has got a mission for you. Go see[ENTER]him and find out what it's all about.
6769	The sick brother
6770	The sick guard
6771	Guardian:
6772	Baek-Go:
6773	Demon Tower Guard:
6774	I'm worried about my brother, the Demon Tower[ENTER]Guard. He's hasn't been feeling well recently and[ENTER]now he's really ill. He's got a really bad[ENTER]headache and a strange skin rash, but he just[ENTER]can't leave his post. Could you get some medicine[ENTER]for him from Baek-Go?
6775	I'd go myself, but the Demon Tower is in the[ENTER]Hwang Temple, right in the centre of the Valley[ENTER]of Seungryong. And the whole place is just[ENTER]swarming with dangerous creatures...
6776	There you are again. You forgot the symptoms? You[ENTER]should try listening when someone's talking to[ENTER]you. My brother has got a headache and a skin[ENTER]rash. Now go tell Baek-Go!
6777	Help the brother
6778	Baek-Go's medicine
6779	Talk to Baek-Go about the medicine for the Demon[ENTER]Tower Guard.
6780	Baek-Go is in %s.
6781	Baek-Go
6782	So you need medicine? It's dangerous to[ENTER]administer medicine on the off chance that its[ENTER]the right one! You have to tell me the symptoms[ENTER]of the illness.
6783	Headaches and rashes
6784	Throat ache and cramps
6785	I don't know.
6786	Sounds like demon scratches to me. This often[ENTER]occurs when too many mite-infested beasts are[ENTER]close by. I can produce something that can help[ENTER]him. You will have to get hold of some[ENTER]ingredients for it though.
6787	I need:
6788	Hunt:
6789	I also need:
6790	I've never heard of such an illness. Are you sure[ENTER]that the Guardian told you the right symptoms?[ENTER]I'd ask him again if I were you.
6791	I can't make a diagnosis without symptoms. Go[ENTER]back and ask again.
6792	Medicine
6793	Good, now I'm just missing %s bundles of herbs.
6794	That should be all the herbs I need. Now quickly[ENTER]go to Baek-Go.
6795	Good, now there's only %s livers left.
6796	Ah, some liver. Now I'm just missing %s.
6797	That should be all the liver I need. Now quickly[ENTER]go back to Baek-Go.
6798	Unfortunately this liver isn't any use to me.
6799	You need another %s x Medicinal Herbs+.
6800	You need another %s x Tiger Livers+.
6801	Now you've got all the ingredients for the[ENTER]medicine. Now go and take it to Baek-Go.
6802	Collect the ingredients for Baek-Go's medicine:
6803	Thanks, now I can make the medicine for the demon[ENTER]scratches.
6804	Finished! Here's your medicine. Its fresh[ENTER]ingredients means that the medicine doesn't keep[ENTER]for very long - so you should deliver it to your[ENTER]patient within the next %s minutes.
6805	You can find the guard's brother in the centre of[ENTER]the Hwang Temple. But be careful on your way[ENTER]there, the Valley of Seungryong is swarming with[ENTER]dangerous creatures!
6806	That's not enough. Did you lose the ingredients[ENTER]on the way over here? I can't do anything for you[ENTER]without the rest of the components.
6807	Demon Tower Guard
6808	Remaining time
6809	Well you still have enough time, but you have to[ENTER]hurry up. So hurry to the guard in Seungryong[ENTER]now, before the medicine goes off!
6810	The time has run out because you were too slow.[ENTER]But you should take the medicine to the Demon[ENTER]Tower Guard anyway. It might still work.
6811	Thanks for bringing me the medicine. The itching[ENTER]is killing me.
6812	Oh, this tastes quite good. I can already feel[ENTER]the itch getting better.
6813	You've earned an especially generous reward for[ENTER]doing this!
6814	You have received 50,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 12,000 Yang.[ENTER]You have received some Gold Threaded Shoes+4.[ENTER]You have received 5 Purple Potions.
6815	Oh, this tastes terrible. The medicine has gone[ENTER]off - how long did it take you to get here? My[ENTER]tongue feels like cured monkey dung.
6816	Hmm, wait a second... it seems to be getting[ENTER]better. Yes, it's working! OK, in that case I'm[ENTER]not going to be mean. You'll get your reward[ENTER]after all.
6817	You seem to have lost the medicine. Please go out[ENTER]on the hunt again and get the ingredients for a[ENTER]new medicine to Baek-Go. I'll become a demon[ENTER]myself soon, if this itching carries on for much[ENTER]longer.
6818	You have received 50,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 8,000 Yang.
6819	You have lost the medicine again? I've never come[ENTER]across such a scatterbrained person in all my[ENTER]life! Oh well, there's not a lot we can do about[ENTER]it.
6820	You have received 25,000 experience points.
6821	Yang-Shin
6822	Yang-Shin:
6823	The deserter
6824	Yang-Shin is having trouble finding good hunting[ENTER]ground. Go see him and find out how you can help[ENTER]him.
6825	Nothing's the way it used to be since the Metin[ENTER]Stones came down. Even going hunting has become[ENTER]impossible in lots of places, because wild[ENTER]animals have started behaving as if they have[ENTER]rabies. The wanderer Nakajima is living out there[ENTER]somewhere, I'm sure he'll know where there's some[ENTER]good hunting ground. Could you look for him and[ENTER]ask?
6826	Nakajima
6827	So you want to know a good place to hunt? Don't[ENTER]be so hasty, if I'm supposed to do something for[ENTER]you, then you should also do me a favour.
6828	You should know... I don't live out here[ENTER]voluntarily. I need to hide because I fled from[ENTER]the atrocities of the military. I just wish that[ENTER]my beloved wife Ah-Yu knew that I'm still alive.[ENTER]Can you take this message to her?[ENTER]But remember that it's for Ah-Yu's ears only![ENTER]In return, she'll tell you where we kissed for[ENTER]the first time - I want to meet her there and its[ENTER]also a great place to hunt.
6829	Nakajima:
6830	Ah-Yu:
6831	Look for Nakajima
6832	Nakajima should know of some good places to hunt.[ENTER]Look for him.
6833	Nakajima is in %s.
6834	Are you Nakajima? Yang-Shin sent me! He's looking[ENTER]for some hunting ground, perhaps you have an idea[ENTER]where hunting might not be so dangerous?
6835	Ah-Yu
6836	Nakajima is a deserter and has to hide from the[ENTER]army now. His wife Ah-Yu thinks that he fell in[ENTER]the war. Let her know that Nakajima is still[ENTER]alive.
6837	Ah-Yu is in %s.
6838	Nakajima... he's alive? My darling husband is[ENTER]alive? I can't thank you enough for telling me![ENTER]It was the Valley of Yonjang that he was talking[ENTER]about. I'm going to head there immediately and[ENTER]meet him.
6839	Thank you for making this reunion possible. Take[ENTER]this Rose with you, perhaps you could give it to[ENTER]a loved one? And now... please excuse me, but I[ENTER]have to hurry!
6840	The Valley of Yonjang - where Nakajima and Ah-Yu[ENTER]first kissed - is still a very good hunting[ENTER]ground.
6841	Yang-Shin will be pleased when he hears this. Go[ENTER]to %s and give him the good news.
6842	The Valley of Yonjang? That does sound plausible,[ENTER]as I have never heard of a Metin Stone[ENTER]contaminating that area. I'll probably be able to[ENTER]get great loot there! Here, you deserve this[ENTER]reward.
6843	You receive 35,000 experience points.
6844	You have received 17,500 Yang.
6845	Yu-Hwan
6846	Yu-Hwan, the musician, needs your help. Go[ENTER]quickly and find out what's going on!
6847	Ah-Yu's worries
6848	Ah-Yu seems to have something on her mind that[ENTER]she doesn't want tell Yu-Hwan. Go visit her and[ENTER]and see if she wants to open up to you.
6849	Ah-Yu is in %s.
6850	I'll talk to Ah-Yu soon!
6851	Ah-Yu:
6852	Yu-Hwan:
6853	Do you know Ah-Yu? She collects herbs for my[ENTER]potions. She used to be in a good mood, but[ENTER]yesterday she seemed completely out of sorts. She[ENTER]just didn't want to tell me what was on her mind,[ENTER]but maybe it's because she works for me?[ENTER]Please go see her and find out how she is.[ENTER]Perhaps she'll open up to you!
6854	It's very nice of Yu-Hwan to worry about me. But[ENTER]yes, there is something on my mind... I didn't[ENTER]want to talk about it, but it's giving me such a[ENTER]hard time! It's about Yang-Shin, the hunter.[ENTER]He's been blackmailing me every since he found[ENTER]out that my husband Nakajima is a deserter.[ENTER]Yang-Shin is threatening to rat on him! And then[ENTER]they'll kill him...
6855	This time he's demanding a Bear Paw in return for[ENTER]his silence. But I can't go off on the hunt now.[ENTER]Could you help me and get Yang-Shin what he[ENTER]wants?
6856	Hunting bears
6857	Let's go hunting! Killing Bera is the best way to[ENTER]get hold of Bear Paws.
6858	I've looted a Bear Paw!
6859	That should be all. Off to Yang-Shin!
6860	This bear's paw is useless.
6861	You need another %s x Bear Paws.
6862	Hunt:
6863	Ah-Yu has asked you to fulfil Yang-Shin's demand.
6864	You need another %s x Bear Paws.[ENTER]Hunt Bera to loot them.
6865	Yang-Shin
6866	You have looted the requested Bear Paw. Take it[ENTER]to Yang-Shin to pay Ah-Yu's debt.
6867	Yang-Shin is in %s.
6868	Yang-Shin:
6869	The blackmail
6870	Bear Paws
6871	You've brought me some Bear Paws? Please don't[ENTER]think badly of me! We live in tough times and I[ENTER]have to make ends meet, now that hunting game has[ENTER]got so difficult and since the Metin Stones[ENTER]turned animals into murderous beasts. Life as a[ENTER]hunter has never been so dangerous.
6872	Please tell Ah-Yu that she's got nothing to worry[ENTER]about. She can count on it. At least until I need[ENTER]something again... hehehe!
6873	What, you wanted to fob me off without loot? I[ENTER]wanted fresh Bear Paws!
6874	It's nice of you to help Ah-Yu. But it also means[ENTER]that you have to do what I say. Now go hunting[ENTER]and don't come back until you have two Bear Paws!
6875	Give Ah-Yu the message that Yang-Shin will stop[ENTER]blackmailing her because you helped him.
6876	You're our saviour! I'm endlessly grateful.[ENTER]Here, take all my Yang. It's not much, but you[ENTER]deserve it.
6877	Thank you, it'll come in very useful!
6878	No, I can't accept this.
6879	This is all that I have. But it's worth it if I[ENTER]can get rid of this barbarous cut-throat.
6880	Oh, thank you! Your place at the Dragon God's[ENTER]side is guaranteed!
6881	You have received %s Yang.
6882	You receive %s experience points.
6883	I need
6884	Yonah
6885	The broken porcelain
6886	Yonah:
6887	My beloved Celadon Porcelain! It's been in my[ENTER]family for three generations and now three of the[ENTER]precious vases are broken. I saw that[ENTER]ne'er-do-well Taurean hanging around the[ENTER]warehouse earlier. I'm sure he's to blame!
6888	It wouldn't be the first foolish thing he's done,[ENTER]but this really crosses the line. Someone should[ENTER]teach him a lesson! Do you have time to do it?
6889	With pleasure
6890	That's none of my business
6891	I don't have time to educate wicked children.[ENTER]You'll have to capture him yourself. However, I[ENTER]doubt that you'll manage it...
6892	Taurean
6893	Yonah's precious family heirlooms, three vases[ENTER]made from celadon porcelain, are all broken. He[ENTER]thinks that Taurean is to blame. Go to Taurean[ENTER]and find out.
6894	Taurean is in %s.
6895	Taurean:
6896	What are you looking at me like that for? I[ENTER]haven't done anything...
6897	What have you done with Yonah's vases?
6898	Vases? Yonah? I just don't know what you're[ENTER]talking about!
6899	Then please could you explain to me again, why[ENTER]three of them are broken.
6900	I swear that I haven't been anywhere near a vase[ENTER]today and I haven't seen Yonah either. In fact, I[ENTER]spent the whole day fighting with Harang. She[ENTER]even locked me in the barn for while! Go and ask[ENTER]her if you don't believe me!
6901	Harang
6902	Taurean claims he's innocent. He was playing with[ENTER]Harang all day and couldn't have broken the[ENTER]vases. Go to Harang and ask if that's true.
6903	Harang, have you seen Taurean recently?
6904	Harang:
6905	Taurean? Yes, we played the whole day. Is[ENTER]something wrong?
6906	Yonah said that Taurean broke three of his vases.
6907	Yonah is mean. He chases Taurean and me away as[ENTER]soon as we come anyway near him. He's always so[ENTER]worried about his porcelain. The only person[ENTER]who's allowed to touch his precious vases is his[ENTER]friend the Stable Boy. Maybe he broke them?!
6908	Harang is in %s.
6909	Stable Boy
6910	Harang confirmed that Taurean is innocent. But[ENTER]they might also be in cahoots with one another.[ENTER]Before you render judgement you should ask[ENTER]Yonah's friend the Stable Boy.
6911	Oh, good old Yonah. So worried about his[ENTER]porcelain that he blames the village children. He[ENTER]doesn't realise that the Metin stones are to[ENTER]blame - ever since they started poisoning our[ENTER]country our resources aren't like they used to[ENTER]be. Even porcelain has started crumbling. But[ENTER]Yonah just refuses to believe it...
6912	If you collected some Hay for him, he could pad[ENTER]out the porcelain in his chests a little bit[ENTER]better. I'm sure it would be a good way to[ENTER]placate him.
6913	The Stable Boy is in[ENTER]%s or %s.
6914	Taurean obviously isn't to blame for Yonah's[ENTER]broken vase. It's the evil radiation from the[ENTER]Metin stones that is making everything brittle.[ENTER]Collect Hay for Yonah so that he can store his[ENTER]porcelain better! I'm sure that some of the[ENTER]villagers can give you some.
6915	You can find %s and %s in front of the gates to[ENTER]the village. You should be able to get a decent[ENTER]amount of Hay out of the straw hats that they[ENTER]wear.
6916	I'll get a nice bundle of Hay out of this. Now[ENTER]I'm just missing another %s.
6917	This hat is not made of straw, but from coconut[ENTER]fibres. It's no use to me.
6918	I see you have a lot of Hay with you. I'm sure[ENTER]Yonah will calm down if you give him some of it.
6919	This hat isn't made of straw, but of coconut[ENTER]fibres. It's also quite damaged...
6920	You can also hunt Savage Infantrymen or Strong[ENTER]Savage Infantrymen. You can get Hay from their[ENTER]straw hats.
6921	You have collected %s of %s bundles of Hay.
6922	You have looted a bundle of hay.
6923	The haystack
6924	Taurean, you mentioned earlier that you were at[ENTER]the haystack earlier. Did you happen to take some[ENTER]Hay with you?
6925	Haha, let's see... it was all in my hair and in[ENTER]my shoes. Can you see it? Here's some more, take[ENTER]it!
6926	It's not much Hay, but it should be enough for a[ENTER]small bundle. Now I'm just missing %s more.
6927	It wasn't me, I swear! Didn't Harang tell you[ENTER]that we were having a fight at the haystack?
6928	You were at the haystack earlier, weren't you?[ENTER]Did you happen to take some Hay with you from[ENTER]there?
6929	How do you know about the haystack? What, I still[ENTER]have Hay in my clothes? Oh yes, here's some!
6930	Can I have that?
6931	I suppose so...
6932	I don't have time right now. I need to go and[ENTER]calm down Taurean about the whole thing with the[ENTER]vases!
6933	Hay for Yonah
6934	Is there some more Hay laying around in the[ENTER]stable that I could bring to Yonah?
6935	Stable Boy:
6936	We don't have much Hay. The wild animals and[ENTER]bandits outside the village have prevented us[ENTER]from cutting down any more of it.
6937	But I can give you a little bit!
6938	It's really not that much, but at least it's[ENTER]enough for a bundle. Now I'm just missing another[ENTER]%s more.
6939	I'm afraid I can't do anything else for you.
6940	Hay instead of hits
6941	You have collected enough Hay for Yonah. Go take[ENTER]it to %s.
6942	It's not Taurean's fault. The radiation from the[ENTER]Metin Stone has made the porcelain brittle.
6943	Yonah:
6944	What did you say? That's complete nonsense, that[ENTER]ne'er-do-well lied to you!
6945	Taurean played in the haystack with Harang all[ENTER]day.
6946	I'm supposed to send you best wishes from your[ENTER]friend the Stable Boy and I've also brought you[ENTER]some Hay to help you protect your vases.
6947	I admit, I am a little embarrassed about my[ENTER]reaction. But you should know that I'm very[ENTER]attached to my porcelain because it brings back[ENTER]good memories of my family. When a vase breaks,[ENTER]its more than just a lost object to me...
6948	I have to apologise to you and Taurean. Here's a[ENTER]small reward for your efforts.
6949	You receive a bonus of %s experience points!
6950	I'm supposed to send you best wishes from your[ENTER]friend the Stable Boy and I've also brought you[ENTER]some Hay to help you protect your vases.
6951	That's very nice of you, but could you get me[ENTER]another %s bundles of Hay so that my vases are[ENTER]really safe?
6952	I think it's going to be hard to find more Hay.[ENTER]But my vases are almost holy to me. I would be[ENTER]incredibly grateful if you got hold of some for[ENTER]me and I'd also give you some Yang for it.
6953	That brat Harang is obviously in cahoots with[ENTER]Taurean.
6954	Apparently no one believes me when I say that I[ENTER]saw the boy hanging around the warehouse earlier.
6955	It's all right. Here's some compensation for your[ENTER]efforts.
6956	Here, %s Yang.
6957	Rumble rumble
6958	Octavio
6959	My stomach is rumbling like a wild boar. Perhaps[ENTER]I should pay a visit to Octavio. He makes the[ENTER]best seafood stew around.
6960	Octavio:
6961	You want some seafood stew? The one with all the[ENTER]heads in it? Oh, I'm sorry, my kitchen hasn't[ENTER]seen any fish for days. Usually the fisherman[ENTER]delivers a fantastic deep-sea fish for my stew.
6962	Well he hasn't been round here for days. Could[ENTER]you perhaps go and ask him what's going on?
6963	Octavio is in %s.
6964	I'm off to find the fisherman!
6965	Fisherman
6966	The untroubled days at sea are over! Fishermen[ENTER]are disappearing every day, it's terrible! Ever[ENTER]since the Metin stones plunged into the sea, the[ENTER]once peaceful whales have transformed into brutal[ENTER]sea monsters. Fishing has become a dangerous[ENTER]trade.
6967	Our spears can't hurt the whales any more. Their[ENTER]skin is tougher than ogre skin!
6968	Perhaps Yonah knows what to do. He used to go to[ENTER]sea quite often and hunted whales for years.
6969	Fisherman:
6970	Octavio is waiting for his deep-sea fish. Ask the[ENTER]Fisherman why the delivery is delayed.
6971	The Fisherman is in %s.
6972	Furious Sea Monsters
6973	The Fisherman has asked you to ask Yonah for[ENTER]advice on how to hunt the evil whales.
6974	Yonah is in %s.
6975	Yonah
6976	I heard about what happened to the whales. It's a[ENTER]bad business for fishermen. Even if they dare to[ENTER]venture out onto the sea, their spears are just[ENTER]too weak to penetrate whale skin. When I used to[ENTER]work on a whaler, we used special weapons for[ENTER]whales with old and scarred skin. They were able[ENTER]to penetrate everything...
6977	It's a special technique to harden whale catching[ENTER]spears. The only person who can make this type of[ENTER]spear is a Blacksmith.
6978	Go to the Blacksmith.
6979	Yonah:
6980	Yonah recommends using very robust and sharp[ENTER]spears for hunting whales. Go to the Blacksmith[ENTER]and ask him if he can make some of those spears.
6981	Blacksmith
6982	Yes, I've heard of those spears and I can also[ENTER]make them. However, so that they can gain the[ENTER]required durability, I do need a Diamond Stone.
6983	I need:
6984	Process:
6985	Blacksmith:
6986	Diamond Stone
6987	Let's see. I need a Pickaxe to mine the stone. I[ENTER]wonder whether mine is around here somewhere or[ENTER]whether Deokbae has to get me a new one?
6988	You need another %s x Diamond Stones.
6989	You have everything that you need. Now quickly go[ENTER]back to the Blacksmith.
6990	Great, now I've got everything that I need. Come[ENTER]back at the same time tomorrow to pick up the[ENTER]spears. Iron like that has to be forged[ENTER]carefully.
6991	You can get a Diamond Stone by chipping at the[ENTER]Vein of Diamond Ore with a Pickaxe.
6992	The Blacksmith needs a Diamond Stone to make[ENTER]special spears for hunting whales. Look for Veins[ENTER]of Diamond Ore, so that you can mine Diamond[ENTER]Stone. If you don't have a Pickaxe for mining,[ENTER]you can buy one from Deokbae.
6993	The Blacksmith is in %s.
6994	We need another %s x Diamond Stones before we can[ENTER]start working on the spears.
6995	The spears
6996	Waiting time
6997	The Blacksmith should be finished by now. Go to[ENTER]him and pick up the special spears for hunting[ENTER]whales.
6998	The spears aren't finished yet. You have to be a[ENTER]little more patient.
6999	Here are your spears. Take them to the Fisherman.
7000	I've already asked you to wait until the spears[ENTER]are finished. Come back later.
7001	You have received some Whale Spears from the[ENTER]Blacksmith. Take them to the Fisherman.
7002	Great! These spears are really impressive! We can[ENTER]protect ourselves from whale attacks now. Please[ENTER]let Octavio know that he'll have fresh fish again[ENTER]soon!
7003	You have received 500,000 Yang.
7004	As a special recognition you have received 3x:
7005	Those aren't enough spears to drive a whale away.[ENTER]It's just enough to tickle their flesh.
7006	Please go back to the Blacksmith again and get[ENTER]him to forge some more spears.
7007	The fishermen are well equipped and can hunt in[ENTER]the open sea again now. Go to Octavio and try to[ENTER]assure him that he will get a new delivery soon.
7008	What did you say? Peaceful whales have become[ENTER]aggressive sea monsters? That's terrible...[ENTER]Thanks for helping the fishermen. A large part of[ENTER]my menu is dependant on their deliveries.
7009	Oh and about your grumbling stomach: Of course I[ENTER]can offer you seafood stew, but wouldn't you[ENTER]prefer some sushi?
7010	You receive 750,000 experience points.[ENTER]You receive 2 pieces of Sushi.
7011	Visiting Wonda-Rim
7012	The orphan
7013	Wonda-Rim
7014	You haven't heard from Wonda-Rim recently. His[ENTER]relationship with his uncle might have improved[ENTER]by now and they may have forgotten the whole[ENTER]episode with Mu-Rang Fur by now. Why don't you go[ENTER]and visit him.
7015	Wonda-Rim is in %s.
7016	It's nice of you to come around.
7017	Wonda-Rim:
7018	I was brought up by my uncle Chaegirab. We've[ENTER]always had a good relationship... but when I ask[ENTER]him about my parents, he avoids the question.[ENTER]They're dead, but that's all he'll tell me.
7019	I want to get married and have a family one day,[ENTER]so I really should know where I came from. Could[ENTER]you talk to my uncle and ask him about my[ENTER]parents? But please don't tell him that I sent[ENTER]you.
7020	I'll talk to him!
7021	Wonda-Rim isn't Chaegirab's biological nephew, he[ENTER]was just raised by him. Now it's time for him to[ENTER]find out who his real parents are. Ask Chaegirab[ENTER]about Wonda-Rim's parentage.
7022	Chaegirab is in %s.
7023	Chaegirab
7024	Chaegirab:
7025	Wonda-Rim... no, I'm not his biological uncle. I[ENTER]don't know who his parents are. I've shielded him[ENTER]from the truth so far because I didn't think he[ENTER]was ready to know it. But maybe the time has[ENTER]finally come.
7026	I found him with a horde of Orc Fighters in the[ENTER]Valley of Seungryong. If there's still a way to[ENTER]find out about Wonda-Rim's parentage, you should[ENTER]be able to find out from the Orcs.
7027	I may be strict with him, but I'll always be his[ENTER]uncle. Even if he stays a ne'er do well.
7028	Go to the Valley of Seungryong and hunt Orc[ENTER]Fighters until you find a clue about Wonda-Rim's[ENTER]parentage.
7029	You have discovered an old letter in a slayed Orc[ENTER]Fighter's dirty bag. It's barely decipherable,[ENTER]but you can just about recognise the name[ENTER]Wonda-Rim on it. This is the evidence you were[ENTER]looking for, so go take it to Wonda-Rim.
7030	Let's go! The best chance you have of finding out[ENTER]about Wonda-Rim's parentage is to kill Orc[ENTER]Fighters. They might be carrying some evidence!
7031	Clues about Wonda-Rim...
7032	I've told you everything that I know. The only[ENTER]clue we have are the Orc Fighters. But[ENTER]unfortunately you can't have a decent[ENTER]conversation with them...
7033	A Letter? Let's see... These characters are[ENTER]really hard to read... It's about a raid,[ENTER]apparently the Orcs burned down the farm and they[ENTER]had to run for their lives. They had to leave[ENTER]their child behind... And here's a name.
7034	Thank you for bringing me that. Now I finally[ENTER]know what happened.
7035	I should talk to Chaegirab. He obviously went to[ENTER]a lot of trouble to save me. I'm going to try and[ENTER]be a better nephew to him. See you soon, my[ENTER]friend!
7036	Information:
7037	You have received 32,000 Yang.
7038	You receive 1,250,000 experience points.
7039	Have you spoken to my Uncle Chaegirab? A hint?[ENTER]What are you talking about? If you have nothing[ENTER]to show, then you should hold back on guessing![ENTER][ENTER]Please ask my Uncle again. After all, I am paying[ENTER]you for it.
7040	Letter from the Captain
7041	Loyal countryman
7042	I would like you to do me a favour. I can't sleep[ENTER]any more and despite Baek-Go's medicine, I just[ENTER]spend the whole night tossing and turning.[ENTER]Could you look for him and ask him for a stronger[ENTER]sleeping medication?
7043	Baek-Go is in %s.
7044	A good night's sleep
7045	Baek-Go
7046	The Captain is having trouble sleeping. Go to[ENTER]Baek-Go and ask him for stronger sleeping pills[ENTER]for the Captain.
7047	Sleeping medication for the Captain? I'm afraid I[ENTER]don't have anything stronger to give you.[ENTER]However, Yu-Hwan could make something on a herbal[ENTER]basis that would give you the required results.
7048	Ah, you got my letter. I don't know what to do[ENTER]any more, I just can't get a good night's sleep.[ENTER]Please help me and ask Baek-Go for advice.
7049	Then I'm better off going to Yu-Hwan!
7050	Baek-Go is in %s.
7051	Baek-Go:
7052	Yu-Hwan is in %s.
7053	Then go to the Captain and tell him that you[ENTER]cannot help him.
7054	Yu-Hwan:
7055	Yu-Hwan
7056	Baek-Go didn't have any stronger medicine left.[ENTER]Yu-Hwan might be able to help though, if he knows[ENTER]of a herb that has the required effect.
7057	I know the Captain well. As you may already know,[ENTER]I have been fulfilling secret missions for him[ENTER]for quite some time. But I can tell you now that[ENTER]herbs won't solve his problems.
7058	There's another reason why the Captain can't[ENTER]sleep any more. And believe me, he knows exactly[ENTER]what the reason is. But it's something he has to[ENTER]sort out himself and I can't do it for him. Go[ENTER]see him and ask him about it.
7059	Captain:
7060	Ah, you got my letter. I just don't know what to[ENTER]do. Please go and ask Baek-Go for his advice so[ENTER]that I can finally get a good night's rest again.
7061	Yes Sir!
7062	Thank you!
7063	I've already seen him and he doesn't have any[ENTER]stronger medicine in supply. But I'm going to[ENTER]look for Yu-Hwan and ask him whether he can help[ENTER]you.
7064	Captain
7065	Yu-Hwan doesn't want to blab about someone else's[ENTER]secrets, so it's probably something quite[ENTER]unpleasant. But it's just no use, you have to[ENTER]talk to the Captain about it. If we don't know[ENTER]what the cause is, we can't solve his sleep[ENTER]problems. So go to %s.
7066	There's no stronger sleeping medication[ENTER]available. But Captain, perhaps I could help you[ENTER]if I found out the reason for your sleeplessness.
7067	It's not something that I would like to tell a[ENTER]young man like you.
7068	It's not something that I would like to tell a[ENTER]young woman like you.
7069	But if I don't get a good night's sleep soon, I'm[ENTER]going to go crazy. I suppose I have to...[ENTER]But remember that this is for your ears only: I'm[ENTER]haunted by four ghosts every night. But that's[ENTER]not the worst of it... I'm responsible for their[ENTER]deaths.
7070	They're four soldiers. They say that they were[ENTER]tortured and killed by summoners and tormentors[ENTER]in the Valley of Seungryong. I was the one who[ENTER]ordered them to go there - I sent them to their[ENTER]deaths!
7071	What can we do about those kinds of ghosts?
7072	They want revenge! What shall I do? If I leave to[ENTER]get retribution, the village will be left without[ENTER]leadership and will be overrun. And if I don't[ENTER]go, I'll go crazy.
7073	If I wasn't responsible for the village's safety[ENTER]I would go immediately. I can only see one way[ENTER]out:
7074	Someone else will have to get revenge for them[ENTER]for me! But how can I send more men into the[ENTER]valley and risk sending them on their road to[ENTER]ruin as well!? I can't ask that of someone just[ENTER]for the sake of sleep?
7075	A decision like that isn't easy.
7076	The good of the village...
7077	It won't be easy...
7078	You can't expect something like that!
7079	... carries more weight than your cowardice. I[ENTER]will avenge your men. And if I don't come back,[ENTER]I'll see you tonight!
7080	... dealing with these summoners and tormentors.[ENTER]But you'll sleep well tonight, I promise!
7081	Have you got a death wish? It's so dangerous[ENTER]taking on summoners and tormentors. Try telling[ENTER]those ghosts how much you are needed here!
7082	You're right. But I still hoped that you would[ENTER]volunteer to do it, therefore rendering both me[ENTER]and my village a great service.
7083	Well...
7084	No, I won't manage that!
7085	...if I'm your last hope, then I'll eliminate[ENTER]those summoners and tormentors for you!
7086	If I try that, another ghost will find you.
7087	OK. Well let me give you some Yang for your[ENTER]efforts.
7088	You receive 20,000 experience points.
7089	You have received 25,000 Yang.
7090	The conversation has been ended.
7091	I hoped you'd say that. But unfortunately I don't[ENTER]know which tormentors or summoners killed them. I[ENTER]hope that I'll feel it when one of the ghosts is[ENTER]released.
7092	I'll send you a letter. The ghosts told me that[ENTER]the revenge has to take place in the Dragon God's[ENTER]Triangle. There are three pillars there that form[ENTER]the vertices of the triangle.
7093	Avenge 4 of the fallen
7094	Letter from the Captain
7095	There are another 3 soldiers to avenge!
7096	You seem to have been successful. I just heard[ENTER]the voice of one of my fallen soldiers. He said[ENTER]that he forgives me now that his death has been[ENTER]avenged. And this is all thanks to you!
7097	Please also avenge the other fallen soldiers and[ENTER]kill Dark Tormentors, Dark Summoners, High[ENTER]Tormentors and High Summoners. Remember that you[ENTER]can only release them in the triangle of the[ENTER]three large Dragon God pillars.
7098	Another 2 soldiers to avenge!
7099	You eliminated another of my soldiers' murderers![ENTER]In the half-light I saw a fallen soldier holding[ENTER]up his hand in a salute.
7100	There's another soldier left to avenge!
7101	You're incredible! A fallen soldier's ghost was[ENTER]standing next to me just a minute ago and he bid[ENTER]me farewell. It'll probably be quite difficult to[ENTER]find the last murderer.
7102	The ghosts that have been plaguing the Captain[ENTER]are the young soldiers that fell during his[ENTER]mission. They were killed by Dark Tormentors,[ENTER]Dark Summoners, High Tormentors and High[ENTER]Summoners.
7103	You have to eliminate the responsible tormentors[ENTER]and summoners in the triangle of the Dragon God's[ENTER]three pillars to avenge the soldiers.
7104	The Dragon God's triangle is in the middle of the[ENTER]Valley of Seungryong.
7105	First soldier avenged
7106	Second soldier avenged
7107	Third soldier avenged
7108	All soldiers avenged
7109	You have avenged all 4 soldiers!
7110	You found the last murderer! The last of the four[ENTER]fallen soldiers just appeared and asked me to[ENTER]thank you for your courage. He also left[ENTER]something here for you: %s
7111	Come see me to get your reward. I'll be waiting[ENTER]for you in %s.
7112	You have done me and my village a great service.[ENTER]Here's the reward that the ghost gave me for you:[ENTER]%s
7113	And here's some Yang from me. I'm going to retire[ENTER]now and finally get some sleep.
7114	I am deeply indebted to you, my son.
7115	I am indebted to you for eternity.
7116	Information:
7117	You have received 3,300,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 270,000 Yang.[ENTER]You have received a Master Book.
7118	Then maybe later? Please go to Baek-Go when you[ENTER]do!
7119	Captain
7120	The fresh supply
7121	It's hard to get our troops motivated at the[ENTER]moment, especially as it's so hard to get fresh[ENTER]supplies. The General Store Saleswoman, an[ENTER]important supplier of ours, has only been sending[ENTER]us a small amount of the potions that we need.
7122	Please go to the General Store Saleswoman and[ENTER]find out what the problems are.
7123	I'll provide you with the potions!
7124	General Store Saleswoman:
7125	Fresh Supplies
7126	General Store Saleswoman
7127	Yes, getting fresh supplies has been really[ENTER]difficult recently. The trade routes have become[ENTER]quite unsafe and highwaymen and wild beasts keep[ENTER]turning up. The Wandering Peddlers, from whom I[ENTER]get my goods, don't have a chance against the[ENTER]tigers.
7128	Perhaps the Captain and his soldiers can help.[ENTER]Please go to him and ask him whether he can send[ENTER]his soldiers there to protect the merchants.
7129	Go to the General Store Saleswoman and find out[ENTER]why there is a delay in fresh potion supplies.
7130	The General Store Saleswoman is in %s.
7131	Captain:
7132	Secure the trade routes? Yes... I'd like to do[ENTER]that. But I just don't have enough soldiers to[ENTER]protect all the Wandering Peddlers from other[ENTER]kingdoms.
7133	Furthermore, we soldiers mustn't hunt tigers.[ENTER]Only the hunters from the hunters' guild are[ENTER]allowed to do that. It wouldn't do the peace in[ENTER]the village any good to violate these[ENTER]regulations.
7134	You should therefore speak to Yang-Shin. He is a[ENTER]member of the hunter's guild. Perhaps he can help[ENTER]you to get the problems with the tigers under[ENTER]control.
7135	Go to the Captain and try to convince him to[ENTER]secure the trade routes from tigers.
7136	The Captain is in %s.
7137	Yang-Shin
7138	Lots of my hunters were enlisted as warriors and[ENTER]fell during the war. Now it has become almost[ENTER]impossible to keep the population of wild animals[ENTER]balanced. The wild cats are a particular problem[ENTER]as they are expanding their territory and[ENTER]endangering travellers.
7139	If you help us with this I can offer you this[ENTER]valuable Tiger Shield+3 which used to belong to[ENTER]my dead comrade Mi-Song as a reward. To get it[ENTER]you should significantly reduce the tiger[ENTER]population.
7140	Particularly the Cursed White Tiger have[ENTER]multiplied uncontrollably.
7141	As proof, I need:
7142	Hunt:
7143	Look for Yang-Shin and try to convince him to[ENTER]secure the trade routes against tigers.
7144	Yang-Shin:
7145	Yang-Shin is in %s.
7146	The Tiger Fur
7147	Ah, a splendid specimen. Just another %s of them!
7148	Done! Now quickly go back to Yang-Shin.
7149	This tiger fur is useless.
7150	You just need another %s x Shimmering Tiger Fur.
7151	Loot Shimmering Tiger Fur from Cursed White[ENTER]Tigers.
7152	I've got the tiger fur.
7153	That's nowhere near enough for me. How shall I[ENTER]find out on the basis of these few furs if the[ENTER]streets are safe again?
7154	Ahh at last! These furs will bring me a big[ENTER]profit... er! You are still here? Thanks to you[ENTER]the roads are finally safe again! I'm sure the[ENTER]Captain will give you a handsome reward.
7155	And now go away. I need to clean the fur.
7156	Oh, the Captain is not giving you a reward? That[ENTER]is not my problem. And in case you are trying to[ENTER]run me down for the furs: Forget it, I'm not[ENTER]going to part with them!
7157	But I did promise you a shield and you shall have[ENTER]one. This dirty old thing isn't any use to me any[ENTER]more anyway.
7158	Reward:
7159	You have received a Tiger Shield+3.
7160	You want to fob me off with a few furs? That way[ENTER]I will my debts... I mean that way the streets[ENTER]will never be safe enough!
7161	Go out on the hunt until you have gathered %s fur! 
7162	That's all, now quickly go back to Yang-Shin.
7163	You have received 3,750,000 experience points.
7164	You have received 125,000 Yang.
7165	Octavio
7166	Octavio:
7167	Old Lady:
7168	The daughter's wedding
7169	Have you got children? Then you will surely[ENTER]understand my worries... it's about my daughter![ENTER]She has met a man who has totally turned her[ENTER]head. And now she has fled to a different kingdom[ENTER]with her lover.
7170	He is from Chunjo. Of course I was against it![ENTER]I thought a lady from Shinsoo can't marry a[ENTER]spiritual dreamer from Chunjo. We parted after an[ENTER]argument, she fled with him to Chunjo.
7171	He is from Jinno. Of course I was against it![ENTER]I thought a lady from Chunjo can't marry a brute[ENTER]from Jinno. We parted after an argument, she fled[ENTER]with him to Jinno.
7172	He is from Shinsoo. Of course I was against it![ENTER]I thought a lady from Jinno can't marry a money[ENTER]making weakling from Shinsoo. We parted after an[ENTER]argument, she fled with him to Shinsoo.
7173	I heard that she wants to marry him there.
7174	Now my daughter is waiting for a sign from me.[ENTER]What shall I do? She is my only child! Of course[ENTER]I'm going to give her my blessing. Please go to[ENTER]the Old Lady for me and ask her to help with the[ENTER]preparations.
7175	Old Lady
7176	Look for the Old Lady and ask her to make the[ENTER]wedding preparations.
7177	The Old Lady is in %s.
7178	A wedding, you say? Well, that is an important[ENTER]moment in a woman's life. Everything has to be[ENTER]right, from the wedding dress and the groom's[ENTER]suit to the engagement rings which the ceremony[ENTER]turns into wedding rings. When the bride's father[ENTER]has given his consent and the necessary Yang for[ENTER]the ceremony have been paid the celebration can[ENTER]be arranged.
7179	The flowers are particularly important - no[ENTER]wedding can take place without a bridal bouquet[ENTER]the groom gives his beloved. The bouquet should[ENTER]have the following flowers:
7180	I need:
7181	Hunt:
7182	I still need:
7183	Come back to me when you have got all three[ENTER]flowers. I'll check whether they are fresh enough[ENTER]and will then make up a nice bouquet. Then you[ENTER]can take it to my sister. She will carry out the[ENTER]ceremony.
7184	Collect a flower of each sort. You'll get them by[ENTER]killing Hungry Alpha Wolves, Hungry Blue Wolves[ENTER]and Hungry Alpha Blue Wolves.
7185	This withered flower isn't particularly[ENTER]decorative. So much work and nothing to show for[ENTER]it!
7186	This withered flower isn't particularly[ENTER]decorative. All this work and nothing to show for[ENTER]it!
7187	This withered flower is not particularly[ENTER]decorative. All this work and nothing to show for[ENTER]it!
7188	You're missing %s Bloodred Flower. You can get it[ENTER]by killing Hungry Alpha Wolves.
7189	You're still missing %s Orange-Coloured Flower.[ENTER]You can get them by killing Hungry Blue Wolves.
7190	You're still missing %s Fragrant Yellow Flower.[ENTER]You can get it by killing some Hungry Alpha Blue[ENTER]Wolves.
7191	You're still missing %s Bloodred Flower.
7192	You're still missing %s Orange-Coloured Flower.
7193	You're missing %s Fragrant Yellow Flower.
7194	This flower is a splendid specimen. Very nice!
7195	This flower is a splendid specimen. Very nice!
7196	This flower is a splendid specimen. Very nice!
7197	Finished! These flowers should make a lovely[ENTER]bunch. Now go back to the Old Lady quickly before[ENTER]the flower heads start drooping!
7198	Collect flowers for the wedding bouquet.
7199	They are pretty flowers, but they're just not[ENTER]special enough for such a grand wedding.
7200	You can get them by killing Hungry Alpha Wolves,[ENTER]Hungry Blue Wolves and Hungry Alpha Blue Wolves.
7201	These flowers should make a beautiful bunch.
7202	Thanks, that looks great! Here, take this bunch[ENTER]of flowers and go to my sister with them.
7203	You can find her in Bokjung area of the Chunjo[ENTER]Kingdom.
7204	You can find her in Bakra area of the Jinno[ENTER]Kingdom.
7205	You can find her in the Yayang area of the[ENTER]Shinsoo Kingdom.
7206	The sister
7207	This is the right kingdom, I should be able to[ENTER]find the Old Lady's sister here.
7208	This is the right kingdom, I should find Octavio[ENTER]here.
7209	This seems to be the right kingdom. Now look for[ENTER]the Old Lady's sister.
7210	That doesn't seem to be the right kingdom.
7211	You have to go to the Bokjung area of the Chunjo[ENTER]Kingdom.
7212	You have to go to the Bakra area of the Jinno[ENTER]Kingdom.
7213	You need to go to the Yayang area of the Shinsoo[ENTER]Kingdom.
7214	Go back to Octavio in Yongan in the Shinsoo[ENTER]Kingdom.
7215	Go back to Octavio in Joan in the Chunjo Kingdom.
7216	Go back to Octavio in Pyungmoo in the Jinno[ENTER]Kingdom.
7217	Here are the flowers for Octavio's daughter's[ENTER]forthcoming wedding. They should be handed to the[ENTER]bride with a blessing. She will know who they are[ENTER]from.
7218	They are beautiful flowers! They will make the[ENTER]bride glow. This completes the preparations.[ENTER]Please tell Octavio that he is invited to the[ENTER]marriage ceremony. I know he'll be delighted.
7219	Now off to Octavio, what are you waiting for?
7220	You've brought flowers for Octavio's daughter's[ENTER]wedding?[ENTER]How nice of you! But... where are they? Did you[ENTER]lose them on your way here?
7221	Go back to your kingdom and get a new bunch of[ENTER]flowers for the wedding.
7222	Go to the Old Lady's sister before the flowers[ENTER]wither away.
7223	Why do you reek of bullfrog soup? Ah well, it[ENTER]doesn't really matter as long as you have good[ENTER]news.
7224	I can't thank you enough. I'm so happy that I'm[ENTER]going to be at my daughter's wedding!
7225	Here, take your reward:
7226	A weapon forged for the hand of a martial arts[ENTER]master. Take good care of it!
7227	You have received %s experience points.
7228	You have received %s Yang.
7229	You are obviously confusing me with a distant[ENTER]relative. I don't have a daughter and don't have[ENTER]enough Yang to be able to arrange a wedding.
7230	Would you care to try a spoonful of my bullfrog[ENTER]soup? I made it using an old recipe of my aunt's.
7231	Heuk-Young
7232	Diary of a Legend
7233	I've found these warrior remains. I don't know if[ENTER]it's the Sura that Heuk-Young's looking for, but[ENTER]I'm sure she'll be interested.
7234	Not just one Sura has died here. I've seen their[ENTER]remains. I wonder whether that legendary warrior[ENTER]is also amongst them? I should report back to[ENTER]Heuk-Young about this.
7235	I've found an old piece of paper, frozen in the[ENTER]Underworld Ice Golem. I can barely read it, but[ENTER]it could be a clue that might interest[ENTER]Heuk-Young.
7236	I've found quite a few things that might interest[ENTER]Heuk-Young. I should go see her and give her the[ENTER]piece of paper. Then I'll also be able to tell[ENTER]her about the body.
7237	Heuk-Young has asked me to keep my eyes peeled[ENTER]for any clues about the legendary Sura.[ENTER]Unfortunately I have no idea what I'm looking[ENTER]for...
7238	Look for the legendary fighter Akuma. He was the[ENTER]most famous Sura who ever lived - an almost[ENTER]invincible warrior. Rumour has it that he even[ENTER]challenged the emperor once. I think that this[ENTER]place here is the place where Akuma disappeared,[ENTER]several hundred years ago. Please look out for[ENTER]clues that might tell us where he was.
7239	dummy
7240	Examine Fallen Warriors
7241	It seems to be the remains of a warrior. The left[ENTER]arm doesn't look human though... it must have[ENTER]been a Sura. I have to tell Heuk-Young about[ENTER]this.
7242	A book page... frozen in the remains of an[ENTER]Underworld Ice Golem...
7243	I can't really tell you what exactly we're[ENTER]looking for. Just have a look around and come[ENTER]back when you've found something.
7244	What have you got there? Let me see!
7245	A note... what kind of writing is this? It must[ENTER]be quite old. You may have found something really[ENTER]important. The things that are written here look[ENTER]familiar. It looks like this page was once part[ENTER]of a book.
7246	If we could find a few more pages, it would all[ENTER]make a bit more sense. Look out for more clues!
7247	There you are again. Have you found something?[ENTER]Tell me!
7248	A dead Sura... it could be him, or it could just[ENTER]be one of his followers. But we need more proof[ENTER]to be sure. Look for clues that might reveal who[ENTER]it is. Weapons, Jewellery, or perhaps notes or[ENTER]something like that.
7249	The skeleton of a Sura and a book page? Let me[ENTER]have a look at the parchment... Hmm, you may have[ENTER]found Akuma's remains. However, we need more[ENTER]proof. Please try and find more book pages.
7250	I have found some evidence already, but I'm not[ENTER]sure if the legendary Sura really was here or[ENTER]not. I need more information.
7251	Good.
7252	Ice Creature
7253	At the edge of despair
7254	Dark terror
7255	The face of death
7256	The fate of the warrior
7257	No, I'm not interested.
7258	I can only decipher parts of the sentences. They[ENTER]say something about courtly life and an excessive[ENTER]love of adventure...
7259	The script on the yellowed parchment is pale and[ENTER]shaky, as if it has been written by a very old or[ENTER]very weak person: "...Ice Creatures. Even my Sura[ENTER]skills didn't help me to defeat them all.[ENTER]Some of them are still wandering the caves and I[ENTER]have to be especially careful in case they find[ENTER]me. Until recently they offered me protection,[ENTER]but now..." At this point the writing on page[ENTER]disappears.
7260	This page is also very worn. By the date at the[ENTER]top corner you can recognise that it seems to be[ENTER]some kind of diary: 'It isn't the first time that[ENTER]wish that I had acted differently when I was[ENTER]looking for the Grotto. I was so proud and[ENTER]pleased with myself! All these things have now[ENTER]led me to my certain death...' The last word is[ENTER]thickly underlined.
7261	The parchment page is very damaged, pieces of it[ENTER]seem to have been ripped out. You can only[ENTER]decipher parts of the message: '... Emperor's[ENTER]court... when the scholars taught me all that I[ENTER]had so desperately wanted to know... easy opening[ENTER]the portal, but... death and terror in the[ENTER]dark...' A big, jagged rip prevents you from[ENTER]being able to read the rest.
7262	You will find a sketch on this page of the[ENTER]parchment: It's a picture of a woman's face.[ENTER]Underneath it are some words written in the[ENTER]script that you are already familiar with.[ENTER]However, the writing looks a lot more shaky and[ENTER]unsettled: 'Death has its claws out - I found[ENTER]this out yesterday. I only had one quick look at[ENTER]the creature, before the fear took over and I had[ENTER]to back away. Oh my beloved Sunmi, if only I had[ENTER]known! If I had known of this unspeakable horror[ENTER]before, I would never have stooped to this[ENTER]level!'
7263	During the Hee-Se Dynastie there lived a[ENTER]legendary Sura called Akuma. He was so talented[ENTER]in battle that he could barely find any opponents[ENTER]that he could test his strength against. One day,[ENTER]he came across some notes about a mysterious[ENTER]place that had long since been sealed away and[ENTER]decided to invest all his time in finding this[ENTER]place. He even managed to learn how to find[ENTER]portals and open them. He promised to return to[ENTER]his lover Sunmi once he had finished his deeds...[ENTER]yet he never returned.
7264	The writing looks really archaic... it's also[ENTER]very shaky and uneven, as if the author didn't[ENTER]have much strength left...
7265	That doesn't make sense. We need more pages.
7266	I'm starting to figure out what might have[ENTER]happened here. But there's still a lot of stuff[ENTER]that I'm not sure about.
7267	Would you like to know the details?
7268	Another page! Whoever wrote these things must[ENTER]have been completely desperate. Should I[ENTER]summarise what it says?
7269	Some of the pages are in such a bad condition[ENTER]that I can only guess what they say. However, I'm[ENTER]starting to make sense of what happened in this[ENTER]cave so many years ago.
7270	Not much is missing. Do want to know what I've[ENTER]found out?
7271	It seems like there aren't too many pages missing.
7272	Do you want to know what I've found out so far?
7273	I have found the last page by the Underworld Ice[ENTER]Golems.
7274	That should be all of the pages now!
7275	I found this page by the Underworld Ice Golems.
7276	I have found a page!
7277	Search Fallen Warriors
7278	There are 3 pages of the fragile parchment lying[ENTER]by the human skeletons. The jagged edges indicate[ENTER]that they have been ripped out of a book. The[ENTER]writing on the page is faded and difficult to[ENTER]read.
7279	I think that that should be enough. I'll take it[ENTER]to Heuk-Young.
7280	I wonder whose remains these are? Well one[ENTER]thing's for sure, he didn't have anything on him[ENTER]that can still be used today.
7281	I've got the pages!
7282	I should go back to Heuk-Young. Perhaps she can[ENTER]fit the pieces of the puzzle together.
7283	I'm surprised that you found so many things in[ENTER]those caves. These pages seem to have been part[ENTER]of a book. The things that are written here are[ENTER]really interesting. It all makes sense when I[ENTER]think about all the other stories I have heard...[ENTER]If you give me these pages, I'll bind them and[ENTER]turn it into a book. Perhaps it might come in[ENTER]handy when you go to the Grotto of Exile. If it's[ENTER]no use to you, I'm sure we'll find someone who[ENTER]will buy it off you.
7284	I have bound the pages into a book and added a[ENTER]couple of my notes. Perhaps they might come in[ENTER]useful to you. I'll tell you the rest of the[ENTER]story if you like.
7285	Yes, tell me more!
7286	No, I'm not interested in that!
7287	What do you want from me? Can't you see that I'm[ENTER]reading?
7288	Soon:
7289	That's a very interesting book that you're[ENTER]holding. Where's it from? Can I have a look at[ENTER]it?
7290	These are the notes from the Grotto of Exile,[ENTER]right? They look ancient. The writing is unusual[ENTER]and the spelling is very old-fashioned... It must[ENTER]have been hard work getting hold of a book like[ENTER]this. Of course I'd love to get my hands on this.[ENTER]Would you perhaps be interested in selling it?
7291	Yes.
7292	No.
7293	How much Yang do you want for the book?
7294	Haha... you're quite the joker. It obviously[ENTER]isn't easy doing business with you. OK, so here's[ENTER]the deal: 500,000 Yang for the Legendary Diary.[ENTER]Take it or leave it!
7295	I'll take the 500,000 Yang.
7296	Let's forget it then.
7297	OK, then forget it!
7298	No, I'm sorry, that's too expensive for me.
7299	Let me make another offer. I'll give you %s Yang[ENTER]for this Legendary Diary.
7300	Are you okay with that?
7301	This is my last offer!
7302	I'll take the %s Yang.
7303	Then I guess we won't be doing business together.
7304	Whatever you want..
7305	It's not exactly cheap. But I want to be generous.
7306	There's a limit to my generosity. I'll give you[ENTER]500,000 Yang for the Legendary Diary.
7307	Just take it or leave it!
7308	OK, then forget it.
7309	What a shame. Ah well, maybe you'll change your[ENTER]mind later.
7310	Soon
7311	The Sombre Wooden Mask
7312	Ah, you're just in time! I heard that you were in[ENTER]the Grotto of Exile recently?
7313	This is the first time that I hear of anyone that[ENTER]ever returned from there. I have to admit, I'm[ENTER]very curious...
7314	I've got a mission for you, but it's quite[ENTER]dangerous. However, I think a man like you might[ENTER]just be able to accomplish it.
7315	I've got a mission for you, but it's quite[ENTER]dangerous. However, I think a woman like you[ENTER]might just be able to accomplish it.
7316	Take this Wooden Mask and go to the Doyyumhwan[ENTER]area. Look for Flame Ghosts there. You might know[ENTER]them already - they are spherical creatures that[ENTER]are completely covered in flames.
7317	If you kill one of them, the Wooden Mask will[ENTER]react and turn into ashes. Don't lose courage if[ENTER]it doesn't work the first time.
7318	Then bring the ash back to me.
7319	If you're going into the wilderness anyway, you[ENTER]may as well bring me %s Chunks of Ice. I[ENTER]desperately need them.
7320	Yetis often have Chunks of Ice on them! So, what[ENTER]are you waiting for?
7321	Fire and Ice
7322	Soon has assigned me to...
7323	I have already found the Chunks of Ice.
7324	I still need:
7325	Apparently I'll be able to find it if I hunt[ENTER]Yetis!
7326	The Sombre Wooden Mask has already transformed[ENTER]into Bewitched Ashes.
7327	I need:
7328	I need to carry
7329	with me. According to Soon, the mask will turn[ENTER]into Bewitched Ashes when I fight the Flame[ENTER]Ghosts.
7330	Now I just need the Bewitched Ashes and Chunks of[ENTER]Ice. Great, wait a second...
7331	It's worked! What the ancient scripts say is[ENTER]really true!
7332	I have produced Black Ice from the items that you[ENTER]brought me.
7333	However, I have another mission for you that is[ENTER]connected to the first one. If you complete this[ENTER]one as well, I will give you all my savings!
7334	Take the Black Ice to the Grotto of Exile and[ENTER]sacrifice it at the Dark Shrine.
7335	%s Chunks of Ice are still missing.
7336	Something's not right.
7337	Great - I see you have the ice with you. Now I[ENTER]just need the Bewitched Ashes.
7338	What are you waiting for...?
7339	Hm... these seem to be normal ashes that aren't[ENTER]bewitched.
7340	Dark Shrine
7341	The Dark Shrine
7342	I'm supposed to take the Black Ice to the Grotto[ENTER]of Exile and sacrifice it at the altar. The[ENTER]sacrificial altar won't be easy to find!
7343	Sacrifice Black Ice!
7344	As you get closer to the altar, darkness appears[ENTER]to close in around you. In the dark, disembodied[ENTER]voices whisper about their eternal anguish. This[ENTER]really is an unholy place. Do you really want to[ENTER]sacrifice the Black Ice?
7345	Yes! What's the worst that could happen?
7346	No, this will all end in tears!
7347	I'm still not sure if I've done the right thing -[ENTER]sacrificing something in the Grotto... I'm sure[ENTER]the Dragon God won't approve. I wish I could take[ENTER]it back.
7348	I don't like this whole thing. Taking a victim to[ENTER]the grotto probably wouldn't get the Dragon God's[ENTER]approval. I won't do it.
7349	That's the wrong Shrine!
7350	Back to Soon
7351	Strange monsters
7352	I should go back to Soon to pick up my reward.
7353	I heard that strange monsters have been sighted[ENTER]in some parts of the country.
7354	I hope it doesn't have anything to do with the[ENTER]fact that I sacrificed the Black Ice in the[ENTER]Grotto of Exile.
7355	Well done! Here's your reward.
7356	Have you seen the monster?
7357	A %s?! My goodness... I have no idea how[ENTER]something like this could've happened... I'm[ENTER]going to research it in my book immediately.
7358	I couldn't sacrifice the Black Ice... it felt so[ENTER]wrong! I'm going to go to Soon and tell him that[ENTER]I won't complete this mission.
7359	The Black Ice
7360	I see you're not carrying the Black Ice with you[ENTER]any more. So you really sacrificed it? Tell me[ENTER]what happened!
7361	Forgive me, but this is a misunderstanding - I've[ENTER]still got the Black Ice. I'm going to get it and[ENTER]come back later...
7362	Ah, there you are! Why have you still got the[ENTER]Black Ice on you?
7363	I can't do what you have asked of me. It would go[ENTER]against the Dragon God's will. I won't sacrifice[ENTER]the ice!
7364	Pha, what a good-for-nothing! Can't even complete[ENTER]the simplest of tasks. Then I'll just have to[ENTER]find someone who's not so squeamish.[ENTER]Give the ice back to me! Come on, give it here!
7365	Should I really give the Black Ice to Soon?
7366	Yes, I want to get rid of it!
7367	No, he might cause trouble!
7368	Here, take the Black Ice and leave me alone!
7369	Are you waiting for me to thank you? Get out of[ENTER]my sight!
7370	You have received 70,000,000 experience points.
7371	You won't get the ice back. I'm going to throw it[ENTER]in the sea - it won't do any damage there!
7372	You wouldn't dare! Give it back to me or I'll[ENTER]curse you and your family!
7373	Do what you like - I won't let you stop me.
7374	Southern Shore
7375	Western Shore
7376	Eastern Shore
7377	At the end of a wrong track
7378	I should go to Yongan and throw the Black Ice[ENTER]into the sea.
7379	I should go to Joan and throw the Black Ice into[ENTER]the sea.
7380	I should go to Pyungmoo and throw the Black Ice[ENTER]into the sea.
7381	Just as you want to throw the Black Ice in the[ENTER]water, it melts. Black liquid drips down from[ENTER]your fingers and onto the floor and then[ENTER]evaporates before you can even touch it.
7382	Suddenly the following objects appear in front of[ENTER]you:
7383	As you pick up the items, you feel satisfied that[ENTER]you made the right decision. And now you hold the[ENTER]Dragon God's gratitude in your hands.
7384	Oh no, I forgot to take the Black Ice with me! I[ENTER]guess there's nothing else for it but to get it[ENTER]and come back here again.
7385	You have also received 120,000,000 experience[ENTER]points.
7387	Open shop
7388	You must hunt:
7386	General Store Saleswoman
7389	Look for the Weapon Shop Dealer and ask him why[ENTER]he doesn't sing under the General Store[ENTER]Saleswoman's window any more.
7390	Collect Lilac
7391	You have looted a pretty Lilac branch!
7392	Finished! Now let's quickly go back to the Weapon[ENTER]Shop Dealer.
7393	Unfortunately this Lilac has already withered.
7394	You need the following number of Lilac branches:[ENTER]%s
7395	That's not enough. This Lilac is only enough for[ENTER]a few drops!
7396	Ahh, Lilac! Now I just need some unusual Musk[ENTER]Oil. You can only order it in a very special[ENTER]shop. A turning coin will show you the way. You[ENTER]will need some Dragon Marks, but I'm sure you've[ENTER]got some stashed away, haven't you? I would be[ENTER]eternally grateful! Afterwards, you can pick up[ENTER]your order from the Storekeeper. Then I would[ENTER]finally have all the ingredients!
7397	Please hurry up and bring me the Musk Oil. You[ENTER]will get a reward for doing it!
7399	Carry on hunting until you can bring me back %s[ENTER]Lilac branches!
7398	My sweetheart
7400	Kill Blue Wolves to get them.
7401	That's all. Now go back to the Weapon Shop Dealer.
7402	The Musk Oil
7403	Thank you so much. Now I can finally produce a[ENTER]new fragrance.
7404	You can tell my songbird that I will be singing[ENTER]at her window again tonight. She will be pleased.
7405	You deserve a reward:
7406	%s Yang
7407	I can't produce my fragrance without the Musk[ENTER]Oil. Please let yourself be led by the turning[ENTER]coin and get me another specimen.
7408	Come back with %s x Musk Oil.
7410	I need to take some Musk Oil to the Weapon Shop[ENTER]Dealer. I'm supposed to let myself be led by the[ENTER]turning coin, order an unusual fragrance oil and[ENTER]pick it up from the Storekeeper.
7409	I miss my sweetheart, the Weapon Shop Dealer. For[ENTER]weeks he was singing below my window every night[ENTER]and now I haven't heard anything from him in[ENTER]days. Perhaps he's afraid of my father. Can you[ENTER]find out what's wrong with him?
7411	The Weapon Shop Dealer
7412	Oh, thank you. So you say he was only held up?[ENTER]What a relief. I'm going to wait for him this[ENTER]evening.
7413	For you efforts you will get: %s experience[ENTER]points.
7414	Go back to the General Store Saleswoman quickly.
7416	Lilac
7415	Speak to the Weapon Shop Dealer
7417	The Musk Oil
7418	A new fragrance
7419	Hunt Blue Wolves
7420	Weapon Shop Dealer
7421	Back to the Weapon Shop Dealer
7422	The rogue
7423	Take Musk Oil to the Weapon Shop Dealer
7424	That's right, I haven't been singing below her[ENTER]window any more because... oh, well, I'm so[ENTER]embarrassed to talk about it! My body odour is[ENTER]getting rather repulsive. I wash all the time,[ENTER]but the odour just won't go away. That's why I[ENTER]want to produce a fragrance oil that can[ENTER]enrapture the General Store Saleswoman, my little[ENTER]songbird, with its tangy and fascinating scent.[ENTER]Outward appearance is very important to her.
7425	To the General Store Saleswoman
7426	I really need to produce a fragrance. It's the[ENTER]only way I can get rid of my unpleasant body[ENTER]odour.
7427	I need to mix several ingredients for that. These[ENTER]need to be mixed first:
7429	You cannot learn this skill as you haven't[ENTER]learned %s.
7428	You must already have started training if you[ENTER]wish to choose from these skills. Your class[ENTER]teacher will be able to give you more[ENTER]information.
7430	You have learned %s Boost!
7431	The damage dealt by your %s skill is permanently[ENTER]increased.
7432	Damage from %s[ENTER]will be reduced.
7433	Do you want to learn the[ENTER]%s skill?
7434	You need more skill points.[ENTER]Increase your level first and then try again.
7435	You cannot master multiple ward skills at once.[ENTER]Forget your current training with the Scroll of[ENTER]Fluid Training. Afterwards you can select a new[ENTER]skill.
7436	This ancient book seems to be very powerful! It[ENTER]is the key to tremendous skills. But first you[ENTER]must decide! Fighters can only master a single[ENTER]skill.[ENTER]Choose wisely!
7437	You have learned %s Ward!
7438	The damage inflicted by %s is permanently reduced. 
7439	You must learn a ward skill first. Only then can[ENTER]you learn a boost skill.
7440	Your skill is already at the highest level.
7441	You have chosen the %s Boost for your training.[ENTER]Do you want to learn this skill?
7442	Test server
7444	I'm a very old man, but I'm still fit and healthy[ENTER]because I have a special secret. I have found out[ENTER]that a potion made of Gango Root Juice and Tue[ENTER]Fungi can prolong your life. If you want to try[ENTER]the potion, take the ingredients to Yu-Hwan. He[ENTER]can brew the potion for you.
7443	Be quiet and maintain your discipline! Behave and[ENTER]don't start any trouble. You should respect your[ENTER]fellow men. Is that understood?
7445	You look quite strong...
7446	For many years, the secret of strength has been[ENTER]passed on in our family. My father told me that[ENTER]if you mix the bell flower into the potion in the[ENTER]right way, the potion will give you extra[ENTER]strength for a short period of time. As far as I[ENTER]know, Beak-Go can brew this potion. You just need[ENTER]to bring him a bell flower. 
7447	Go, tell it on the mountain...
7448	Yu-Hwan, the musician:
7449	...over the hills and everywhere... Do you also[ENTER]like music? I sing all kinds of songs in solitude[ENTER]here, so that I don't get caught up in the war.[ENTER]But without a country to protect me, I wouldn't[ENTER]be able to keep doing what I do.
7450	Why do you read so much?
7451	Soon, the bookworm:
7452	Oh, adventurer! The world is full of problems.[ENTER]You can only survive with a certain amount of[ENTER]knowledge. So honour you books. In bad times -[ENTER]and nowadays the times are always bad - they will[ENTER]help you. Believe me!
7453	Have you got children?
7455	Actually I didn't want any children, but...[ENTER]Well I keep collecting Kaki Blossoms because if[ENTER]you prepare them properly, you can strengthen[ENTER]your magical energy with them. Baek-Go found that[ENTER]out. He only needs a single blossom to make 100[ENTER]potions. Unfortunately the Kaki Blossom also has[ENTER]a side effect. If a woman wears a necklace made[ENTER]from this blossom, she will have a son. Between[ENTER]you and me, my wife shamelessly took advantage of[ENTER]this.
7454	Mmm, it smells good here...
7456	What's wrong with your foot?
7457	Handu-Up:
7458	It's getting better. While taking a walk[ENTER]recently, I stumbled over a Gango Root and[ENTER]sprained my ankle. Luckily I know the doctor[ENTER]Baek-Go, so he treated me and gave me some[ENTER]advice: To heal small wounds you can brew a[ENTER]potion from these same Gango Roots. So I made the[ENTER]culprit roots into a tea and it cured the damage[ENTER]that it had made...
7459	Who are you?
7460	Wonda-Rim:
7461	I am Wonda-Rim, Chaegirab's nephew. My uncle is[ENTER]famous! Do you know him? He experiments a lot[ENTER]with potions and herbs. Whilst doing this, he[ENTER]found out that you can get a large amount of[ENTER]protection against magical energy if you mix 100[ENTER]Bo Water with a Mulberry. As far as I know,[ENTER]Huahn-So can produce the potion if you take the[ENTER]ingredients to him.
7462	Why have you got so many scars?
7463	Traitor Balso:
7464	I'm not a good fighter and I constantly got hurt[ENTER]in war. At some point I asked Yu-Hwan whether he[ENTER]could brew a potion for me that could protect my[ENTER]body from injuries. He brewed me something from[ENTER]Bellflower Juice and Lilac, but unfortunately the[ENTER]protection wasn't sufficient. Or perhaps it was[ENTER]just my own incompetency. But I'm sure the potion[ENTER]will help you.
7466	Why do so many people call you a traitor?
7465	Octavio, the restaurant owner:
7467	I fled from the war and joined the Black Wind[ENTER]Gang. My comrades never forgave me for that.[ENTER]Afterwards I found out that the Black Wind[ENTER]Warriors kill innocent people, so I immediately[ENTER]left them. It was awful!
7468	You have innocent people on your conscience? Then[ENTER]you really do deserve your name. You stopped them[ENTER]from leading a good life.
7469	We live in a lawless world. But I have decided[ENTER]that I won't do anything bad any more, ever[ENTER]again. I don't want people to keep describing me[ENTER]as a traitor.[ENTER][ENTER]Have you got some Yang for me?
7470	They call you the scholar?
7471	Uriel the wise:
7472	There are so many things to learn in this vast[ENTER]world. Ignorance paired with military power is an[ENTER]especially dangerous combination. You don't want[ENTER]to live like these ignorant soldiers, right?[ENTER]Knowledge is power!
7473	My sources tell me that you practise medicine?
7474	I do what I can. But there are more and more[ENTER]casualties every day in this dangerous world. We[ENTER]don't have enough medicine or helpers. Times are[ENTER]hard! Perhaps you could give me a hand later?
7475	How's the hunting business going?
7477	Yang-Shin the hunter:
7476	Welcome! Our traditional restaurant is so[ENTER]successful that we could open restaurants[ENTER]worldwide. If you want to have something yummy to[ENTER]eat, then come around and give our food a try.
7478	Hmm, ever since the Metin stones came down,[ENTER]animals have become really wild. Nowadays, you're[ENTER]already risking your life when you go out to hunt[ENTER]some chickens. It's a dangerous time for hunters.[ENTER]Luckily, I'm one of the best!
7479	Where does your high accuracy come from?
7480	I'm great with a bow, because I have a special[ENTER]recipe, hehe! When you mix Peach Blossom Juice[ENTER]with Lilac, you get a potion that increases your[ENTER]accuracy. Take the ingredients to Yu-Hwan, I'm[ENTER]sure he'll brew the potion for you.
7481	Such a nice floral wreath...
7482	I used to collect Peach Blossoms with my brother.[ENTER]But I have to do it alone today. They don't look[ENTER]very pretty, but they have a special effect.[ENTER]If you take a Peach Blossom to Baek-Go, he'll[ENTER]brew a potion from it that makes you very[ENTER]nimble-footed!
7483	Where's your brother?
7484	Recently my brother has been travelling a lot. I[ENTER]barely see him any more and I worry a lot about[ENTER]him.
7485	You sell rice cakes?
7486	Yu-Rang, the Rice Cake seller:
7488	It is difficult to sell Rice cakes because of the[ENTER]war. Thanks to the bandits, I have lost lots of[ENTER]customers. I just don't know what I should do for[ENTER]a living any more.
7487	Although it is a big restaurant, the furnishing[ENTER]is surprisingly simple.
7489	Who usually buys goods from you?
7490	I sell most of my cakes to travellers. One day, a[ENTER]mysterious cavalier dressed in black came to see[ENTER]me. As payment, he gave me a recipe that you can[ENTER]make with Zin Water. It's a potion that improves[ENTER]your attack power. I sold the recipe to Huahn-So.[ENTER]If you take some Sim Water and an Alpine Rose to[ENTER]Huahn-So, he will produce some Zin-Water for you.
7491	Why do you look so sad?
7492	Oh, who could have known that our sweet dreams[ENTER]would be shattered so mercilessly... My poor[ENTER]husband, he fell during battle! ... Please avenge[ENTER]his death.
7493	So many people have fallen in the war...
7494	We're losing more and more men in the war, so the[ENTER]women in the village gathered together and asked[ENTER]Huahn-So to create a better healing potion.[ENTER]After a lot of research, he produced a potion[ENTER]which increases defence, so that less healing[ENTER]potions have to be used. Go see him. I'm sure he[ENTER]can produce the potion, that he calls[ENTER]SamBo-Water, for you. He just needs some[ENTER]Dok-Water and a Alpine Rose to make it.
7495	Oh, what a cute child...
7496	Ah-Yu:
7497	He is screaming again... I don't know whether he[ENTER]wants some sweets or... oh no!
7499	How are you two?
7498	Tell me something about pottery.
7500	My child! Now that my husband has fallen in the[ENTER]war, I need to look after myself. I am trying to[ENTER]support myself and my child on my own. And thanks[ENTER]to the Bo Water, I have found a way to make a[ENTER]living. I need to bring Yu-Hwan 100 Kaki Blossom[ENTER]Juices and one Tue Fungus. He brews Bo Water from[ENTER]these things, which sells really easily. After[ENTER]all, I need to get by somehow...
7501	How is your husband?
7502	Aranyo:
7503	My so-called husband is married to his books. He[ENTER]barely even looks at me any more. And I'm not an[ENTER]ugly woman.
7504	How's business?
7505	Since the war broke out, business has been really[ENTER]bad. The merchant's union was once a rich and[ENTER]powerful union, but those days are over now. We[ENTER]cannot keep on ignoring the wild, the white oath[ENTER]soldiers and the black wind soldiers any more.
7506	Why are you in such a bad mood?
7507	Taurean:
7508	Harang is a bad girl! I hate her! I'm weak, and[ENTER]she's always picking on me!
7510	You're a man, and you have muscles. Work them out[ENTER]a bit!
7509	Yonah the potter:
7511	What are you doing at the moment?
7512	Harang:
7513	I'm waiting for Taurean. We often play together[ENTER]and we fight a lot too. What a coward! If he[ENTER]doesn't come voluntarily, I'll give him a really[ENTER]hard time!
7514	Taurean is scared of you.
7515	Taurean is actually stronger than me. So now I've[ENTER]thought of a way that I can win anyway. A white[ENTER]Ninja told me that you can mix Young Water with a[ENTER]Mulberry and make a potion that makes you hit[ENTER]more quickly. Then I'll finally be able to defeat[ENTER]Taurean! If you also want to becomes a quick[ENTER]attacker, then take the the ingredients to[ENTER]Huahn-So. I'm sure he'll make the potion for you.
7516	New insight...
7517	Seon-Pyeong:
7518	My friend, the world is full of unanswered[ENTER]questions. And I, am a seeker of answers and a[ENTER]seeker of knowledge. Have you ever heard of epic[ENTER]weapons and Spirit Stones?
7519	What are you doing?
7521	You probably already know that I research unknown[ENTER]knowledge. And at the moment I'm looking into a[ENTER]method of further reinforcing weapons and[ENTER]improving the power of the Spirit Stones.
7520	I like being a potter. It's very satisfying to[ENTER]mould clay with your own hands and to see how[ENTER]something is being created... I usually only make[ENTER]simple things. In the east, on the outskirts of[ENTER]the continent, the production methods are a lot[ENTER]more developed. I saw some pottery there once and[ENTER]I was really inspired. Sometimes, when I have the[ENTER]time, I try experimenting. But I still haven't[ENTER]found out which trick they use.
7522	The weapon research...
7523	Interesting isn't it? Do you want to know more[ENTER]about it? Then please bring me the appropriate[ENTER]level 65 weapon +9. I also need a Fencing[ENTER]Pamphlet and two Blessing Scrolls. I'll try to[ENTER]make you an epic weapon out of them.
7524	However, I can't promise that it'll work.
7525	The Spirit Stones...
7526	Spirit Stones are widely used, but although they[ENTER]are used a lot, most people don't really know[ENTER]what their true power is. But my research has[ENTER]helped me to find out a lot more about them. If[ENTER]you bring me another Spirit Stone, I can improve[ENTER]it for you.
7527	You're very sprightly for your age...
11213	Exchange Indian Armband
11214	I really needed that.

7529	Help me!
7530	Dratted thieves...[ENTER]They broke into my house last night![ENTER]They've stolen the Hero's Medal. My ancestor was[ENTER]awarded the medal after he ran 42.195 km from the[ENTER]battlefield to his emperor, to tell him about[ENTER]their battle victory.[ENTER]And now it's gone!
7531	Oh dear... it has sentimental value to my family[ENTER]and I. What on earth should I do?
7532	Will you help me?
7533	Hero's Medal
7534	Finally! You're back![ENTER]Did you find the Hero's Medal?
7535	But why? What do those thieves want to do with my[ENTER]medal? It's worthless to strangers! Can you help[ENTER]me find it?
7536	Find the Hero's Medal!
7537	You've returned empty-handed? Oh no, I'm so[ENTER]distressed. If you can't help me, then who can?[ENTER]Carry on looking, please!
7538	You've found my medal![ENTER]But wait... that's just one piece of it. What a[ENTER]disgrace, they broke it into five pieces![ENTER]Please bring me all the fragments! Then I might[ENTER]be able to put the medal back together.
7539	Those wretched criminals have broken my family[ENTER]heirloom! Thank you for finding all the pieces.[ENTER]Now I can put the pieces back together.
7540	Thank you so much! You've restored my family's[ENTER]honour. Of course all your trouble will not be in[ENTER]vain. Here's your just reward!
7541	Do you really want to decline this mission? If[ENTER]you select 'yes', you will not be able to accept[ENTER]it later.
7542	I understand if you don't have enough time for it[ENTER]now. Come again when it suits you better. But[ENTER]don't make me wait for long!
7543	Unfortunately you arrived too late and can't help[ENTER]me now. I wish you all the best for the future!
7544	Hunt the monsters that stole from me! But be[ENTER]careful, they were very strong - at least level[ENTER]30. If you bring back my Hero's Medal, I will[ENTER]give you a generous reward!
7545	Find the Hero's Medal and take it to Yu-Hwan.
7546	Yu-Hwan needs your help. Go see him! You will[ENTER]find him in the second village.

11883	Cough, cough...[ENTER]I think I've been talking too much... I wish I[ENTER]had a cure.
11884	Could you see if there's a cure nearby?

11895	I'll be okay. Please go and rescue the others...[ENTER]I'll just sit here a while and rest.[ENTER]Even if I lie down again now, it doesn't mean I'm[ENTER]still ill. Just go and help the others.
11896	Cough, cough...[ENTER]Where's the Medicine?[ENTER]Please find it fast...
11897	Rescue the Weapon Shop Dealer.
11898	I need to check if the villagers are still alive.[ENTER]I should look for the Weapon Shop Dealer.
11899	Go to the centre of the village to find the[ENTER]Weapon Shop Dealer.
11900	Weapon Shop Dealer found.
11901	He's not responding.[ENTER]He's buried in the ash.
11902	I need to return to the uncontaminated place[ENTER]where I found the Medicine for the injured man[ENTER]and look for traces there.
11903	Go back to the place where you found the Medicine[ENTER]for the wounded man earlier and search for more.
11904	Find traces at the uncontaminated place.[ENTER]Destroy Metin stones to find the Medicine.
11905	Medicine remaining
11906	I have the Medicine. Now quickly go back to the[ENTER]Weapon Shop Dealer!
11907	Go to the Weapon Shop Dealer.
11908	Give him the Medicine.
11909	I need more Medicine...[ENTER]You need more Medicine to save the Weapon Shop[ENTER]Dealer.[ENTER]Destroy Metin stones to find more Medicine.
11910	Ohh, what happened?[ENTER]I think you saved my life... Thanks.[ENTER]I was sure I was going to die.
11911	I hope you can save the other villagers too.[ENTER]This soul has been handed down in my family for[ENTER]generations, but I think you need it more than I[ENTER]do.[ENTER]Forging something like this from scratch would[ENTER]take a very long time. So take good care of it.
11912	Weapon Shop Dealer
11913	I need more Medicine to help all the villagers.[ENTER]Next I should find and help the Armour Shop[ENTER]Dealer.
11914	Rescue the Armour Shop Dealer
11915	I need to check if the villagers are still alive.[ENTER]I should check on the Armour Shop Dealer.
11916	I've found the Armour Shop Dealer.[ENTER][ENTER]So it's true that the village was attacked...[ENTER]I need to find more of the Medicine that I gave[ENTER]to the Weapon Shop Dealer.
11917	I will get more Medicine.[ENTER]Hold on Armour Shop Dealer!
11918	Missing Medicine: %d
11919	Return to the place where you already helped the[ENTER]wounded man and destroy more Metin stones to get[ENTER]more Medicine.
11920	I need to return to the uncontaminated place to[ENTER]find more Medicine.[ENTER]If I destroy more Metin stones, I can get more[ENTER]Medicine.
11921	Collected all Medicine.[ENTER]Go to the Armour Shop Dealer.
11922	I need more Medicine.[ENTER]More Medicine is needed to save the Armour Shop[ENTER]Dealer.[ENTER]Destroy Metin stones to receive Medicine.
11923	After a brief moment, the Armour Shop Dealer[ENTER]wakes up.
11924	Armour Shop Dealer
11925	Ugh, what happened?[ENTER]I can't remember anything...[ENTER]Wait, what do you think you're doing here?
11926	So evil powers did all of this... I see.[ENTER]You are a true hero. Please continue to fight for[ENTER]our village![ENTER]I have created this Protection Soul. Here, take[ENTER]it as a reward.
11927	Thank you, I will take good care of the soul.[ENTER][ENTER]It looks like the Alchemist could also use my[ENTER]help.[ENTER]I will look for him.
11928	Rescue the Alchemist
11929	I need to check if the villagers are still alive.[ENTER]I should check on the Alchemist.
11930	I've found the Alchemist.[ENTER]Damn it, not the Alchemist as well![ENTER]I need even more Medicine.
11931	I hope I have enough Medicine left. I should[ENTER]check my bag quickly.
11932	I have the Medicine! Now get to the Alchemist[ENTER]quickly!
11933	Collected all Medicine.[ENTER]Return to the Alchemist.
11934	I need more Medicine to save the Alchemist.[ENTER]If I destroy more Metin stones, I can find more[ENTER]Medicine.
11935	After a brief moment, the Alchemist wakes up.
11936	Alchemist
11937	Ohh, my head.[ENTER]What's happened here?[ENTER]The last thing I remember is these evil creatures[ENTER]attacking our village.
11938	(The Alchemist listens to your story.)[ENTER]I see. So that's what happened.[ENTER][ENTER]I can help you with something I poured all my[ENTER]skill into. I prepared it for a situation like[ENTER]this, but I can't use it myself.[ENTER][ENTER]I bet you'll find it useful.
11939	I wonder how our village elder Uriel is. I must[ENTER]check on him as quickly as possible.
11940	Save Uriel
11941	I need to check if the villagers are still alive.[ENTER]If I help Uriel, he might be able to find a[ENTER]solution.
11942	I've found Uriel.[ENTER]Uriel has been affected as well.[ENTER]I need even more Medicine.
11943	I hope I have enough Medicine left. I should[ENTER]check my bag quickly.
11944	I have the Medicine! Now get to Uriel quickly!
11945	Collected all Medicine.[ENTER]Return to Uriel.
11946	After a brief moment, Uriel wakes up.
11947	I need more Medicine to save Uriel.[ENTER]If I destroy more Metin stones, I can find more[ENTER]Medicine.
11948	Uriel
11949	Gaah...[ENTER]I feel terrible.[ENTER]I guess I'm just getting too old.
11950	(Uriel listens to your story.)[ENTER]I see. We need to find out where those demons[ENTER]disappeared to...[ENTER][ENTER]Yes! Chaegirab should be able to find out more[ENTER]about these strange occurrences.[ENTER][ENTER]I have a piece of jewellery that I've been hiding[ENTER]for years, but I think you'll need it.[ENTER][ENTER]Here, take it.
11951	Thank you, Uriel! I'll go straight away to[ENTER]Chaegirab.
11952	Save Chaegirab
11953	I need to save Chaegirab so he can find out more[ENTER]about what has happened.[ENTER]I should look for him quickly.
11954	It got Chaegirab too.[ENTER]Maybe I still have some Medicine left in my bag...
11955	I have the Medicine! Now get to Chaegirab quickly!
11956	Collected all Medicine.[ENTER]Return to Chaegirab to complete the quest.
11957	After a brief moment, Chaegirab wakes up.
11958	I need more Medicine to save Chaegirab.[ENTER]If I destroy more Metin stones, I can find more[ENTER]Medicine.
11959	Chaegirab
11960	Where am I?[ENTER]Ah... in my home village.[ENTER](Chaegirab listens to your story.)[ENTER]And that's really what happened?[ENTER]I cannot remember anything else.
11961	Why is everything so red around here?[ENTER]I have no idea what this ash it.[ENTER]I also need to find out what happened to me.
11962	First, we should find out more about this red ash.To do that, I'll need a whole load of it.[ENTER]Can you collect some for me?
11963	How should I do that?
11964	The monsters nearby should be covered in it.[ENTER]Kill them and gather the ash.
11965	Kill monsters in the surrounding area and gather[ENTER]%d piles of ash.
11966	Collect ash.
11967	I should kill monsters in the area and gather ash.
11968	Piles of ash remaining
11969	I've gathered all the piles of ash! I should[ENTER]return to Chaegirab on the new continent.
11970	Collect ash.
11971	Ah, you've gathered them all. I had a few[ENTER]samples, but it was nowhere near enough for my[ENTER]investigations.[ENTER]But together with yours, I'll have more than[ENTER]enough!
11972	Here, take this as a token of my appreciation.[ENTER]I put all my effort into this one masterpiece...[ENTER]It'll take me a very long time to make something[ENTER]like that again.
11973	Your inventory is full. Free up some space and[ENTER]talk to me again.
11974	Remaining number: %d
11975	I have the Medicine! Now get to the Armour Shop[ENTER]Dealer quickly!
12697	Piles of ash collected: %d
11980	Do you want to face the challenge and gather all[ENTER]the materials I need?
11981	Yes
11982	No
12033	Go and see Uriel on the new continent to earn[ENTER]yourself a Jewellery Soul.
12034	Jewellery Soul (Reproducible)
12035	What? You want another one of those pieces of[ENTER]jewellery I don't have any more of?[ENTER]All the ones I had are gone...[ENTER]It'll take a very long time to make something[ENTER]like that again.
12036	Hey, stop playing tricks on me or you won't get[ENTER]anything else!
12037	It'll be very difficult to make another one of my[ENTER]soul-imbued pieces of jewellery.[ENTER]Bring me 10 Jewellery Soul Fragments and I'll see[ENTER]what I can do.
12038	Hunt monsters to gather 10 Jewellery Soul[ENTER]Fragments.
12039	Gather 10 Jewellery Soul Fragments.
12040	I've gathered 10 Jewellery Soul Fragments.[ENTER]I should return to Uriel on the new continent.

12042	Create Jewellery Soul
12043	Something feels peculiar about your fragments.[ENTER]Don't expect too much.
12044	Phew, I can hardly believe that I've actually[ENTER]done it![ENTER]Here you go, just as you asked.
12045	Oh dear... One of the fragments you brought me[ENTER]was defective![ENTER]I'm afraid that means you'll have to bring me new[ENTER]materials if you want me to try again.
12070	Uriel produces a Jewellery Soul.
12071	It is time! The creation of a Jewellery Soul[ENTER]should be complete.[ENTER]I should go and see Uriel on the new continent.

12004	Why are you even asking then? It's a hell of a[ENTER]lot of work for me too...
12005	I'll be difficult to produce another Protection[ENTER]Soul.[ENTER]Bring me 10 Protection Soul Fragments and I'll[ENTER]see what I can do for you.
12006	Hunt monsters to gather 10 Protection Soul[ENTER]Fragments.
12007	Gather 10 Protection Soul Fragments.

12010	Let me see... You haven't gathered all 10[ENTER]fragments yet.
12011	Oh, you actually managed it.[ENTER]Now I have to put my heart and soul into my work.[ENTER]Please give me some time.[ENTER]And don't expect too much. The process is very[ENTER]complicated, as I say.
12012	Create Protection Soul
12013	Back already?[ENTER]You're not trying to spy on me, are you?
12014	Phew, I can hardly believe that I've actually[ENTER]done it![ENTER]Here you go, just as you asked.
12015	I'm sorry... I forgot to add a catalyst in the[ENTER]final step...[ENTER]So it failed.[ENTER]If you bring me some new materials, I'm sure I[ENTER]can make it up to you. Please don't kill me!
12017	Excellent timing.[ENTER]Let me show you the result.[ENTER]Give me a moment...
12066	The Armour Shop Dealer produces a Protection Soul.

12020	Light Soul (Reproducible)
12021	What? You want another one of those element I've[ENTER]run out of?[ENTER]All the ones I had are gone...[ENTER]It'll take a very long time to make something[ENTER]like that again.
12022	It'll be very difficult to make another one of my[ENTER]soul-imbued elements.[ENTER]Bring me 10 Light Soul Fragments and I'll see[ENTER]what I can do.
12023	Hunt monsters to gather 10 Light Soul Fragments.
12024	Gather 10 Light Soul Fragments.
12025	I've gathered 10 Light Soul Fragments.[ENTER]I should return to the Alchemist on the new[ENTER]continent.

12028	You seem to think that's all there is to it.[ENTER]Don't expect too much.
12029	Phew, I can hardly believe that I've actually[ENTER]done it![ENTER]Here you go, just as you asked.
12030	Oh no... The element disintegrated in the final[ENTER]step.[ENTER]Hey, I told you they're difficult to make.[ENTER]If you want me to try again, you'll have to bring[ENTER]me some new materials.
12068	The Alchemist produces a Light Soul.

12049	Soul Relic (Reproducible)
12050	What? You want me to give you another Soul Relic?[ENTER]It was the result of very painstaking research.[ENTER]And you simply ask for another one... Haha![ENTER]I'm going to need more ash then. First bring me[ENTER]enough of it, then I'll see what I can do.
12051	I guess I don't have a choice then.
12052	Looks like I'm going to have to spend night and[ENTER]day researching again.[ENTER]Just bring me enough materials and I'll help you.[ENTER]Gather 20 piles of ash.
12053	Hunt monsters to gather 20 piles of ash.
12054	Bring 20 piles of ash to Chaegirab so he can make[ENTER]you a Soul Relic.
12055	I've gathered 20 piles of ash.[ENTER]I should return to Chaegirab on the new continent.
12056	Here. I've got all 20 piles of ash.
12057	Oh... You've got them all already?[ENTER]I can start production right away then.[ENTER]Please give me some time.[ENTER]Please don't expect too much as the process is[ENTER]extremely complicated.
12058	Create Soul Relic
12059	Back again already?[ENTER]Wait, what was your class again?[ENTER]Ah yes, of course. Just come back later.
12060	Let me see... You still haven't gathered all 20[ENTER]piles of ash.
12061	Phew, I can hardly believe that I've actually[ENTER]done it![ENTER]Here you go, just as you asked.
12062	Oh dear. I'm sorry but I forgot which class you[ENTER]were...[ENTER]And I accidentally made a relic for a different[ENTER]class.[ENTER]I gave it away to someone of the right class[ENTER]earlier.[ENTER]I'm afraid there are no more materials left now.[ENTER]But if you gathered more of them for me...[ENTER]I'd gladly try to make you a Soul Relic again.[ENTER]I'm sure I won't make the same mistake again.
12072	Chaegirab produces a class-specific Soul Relic.
12073	It is time! The creation of a Soul Relic should[ENTER]be complete.[ENTER]I should go and see Chaegirab on the new[ENTER]continent.

11978	Sword Soul (Reproducible)
11979	What? You want me to give you another[ENTER]Sword Soul from my family?[ENTER]All the ones I had are gone...[ENTER][ENTER]It'll take a very long time to make something[ENTER]like that again.
11983	Yes, I don't want to have to forge it again[ENTER]either.

11997	Your inventory is full.
11998	Oh no... It shattered in the very last step of[ENTER]all times.[ENTER]Hey, I told you they're difficult to make.[ENTER]If you want me to try again, you'll have to bring[ENTER]me some new materials.

7712	Progress of the qualification test
7713	Kill 20 Savage Archers within 30 minutes and come[ENTER]back here afterwards!
7714	Leave
7715	Do you really want to cancel the qualification[ENTER]test?
7716	No, just kidding.
7717	Make sure that you're successful next time.
7718	Stable Boy:
7719	You don't have time to stand around here. Hurry[ENTER]up! Kill those Savage Archers and come back!
7721	You have finished the test successfully, very[ENTER]good. You need a Horse Picture to be able to[ENTER]ride. It will take some time before I can make[ENTER]you one. Come back tomorrow. Don't forget that[ENTER]the Horse Picture costs 100,000 Yang!
7720	You need to have level 25 to be able to ride. In[ENTER]my opinion, you need to get a little bit better[ENTER]first though.
7722	The Horse Picture is being produced.
7723	The Stable Boy is making a Horse Picture for you[ENTER]but it takes some time. Go to him once the Horse[ENTER]Picture is ready.
7724	Is the Horse Picture ready?
7725	It will take a while before it's ready.[ENTER]Remember to bring 100,000 Yang!
7726	Go to the Stable Boy
7727	The Stable Boy has finished the Horse Picture. Go[ENTER]to him and pick it up.
7728	I want to collect the Horse Picture.
7729	Stable Boy:
7730	I have finished the Horse Picture. Now, you can[ENTER]ride a beginner's horse and so move faster.[ENTER]The Horse Picture costs 100,000 Yang.[ENTER]Do you want to buy it?
7732	Do not buy
7731	If you want to ride, you need to take a[ENTER]qualification test first. To participate in the[ENTER]qualification test, you need to give me a Horse[ENTER]Medal. The easiest way to get one is in the[ENTER]Monkey Dungeon in the second village. The monkeys[ENTER]won't just hand it over to you though...
7733	This picture allows you to call the horse from[ENTER]wherever you are. If you lose the picture, you'll[ENTER]have to pay for a new one. So, take good care of[ENTER]it!
7734	You don't have enough Yang for the Horse Picture!
7735	Come back later.
7736	Do you really want to give up the Horse Picture[ENTER]mission? If you cancel it now, you'll have to[ENTER]start the quest all over again.
7737	No
7738	Time limit exceeded!
7739	You did not pass the qualification test because[ENTER]you did not manage to kill 20 Savage Archers[ENTER]within 30 minutes.
7740	In order to repeat the challenge, take a Horse[ENTER]Medal to the Stable Boy and apply for a new[ENTER]qualification test.
7741	Ohh, you have the Horse Medal, great! Now you[ENTER]need to prove that you have the necessary[ENTER]qualifications for riding. Please kill 20 Savage[ENTER]Archers within 30 minutes. If you manage that,[ENTER]then you're ready to ride.
7742	Come again if you're still interested.
7743	Apparently, there is a problem with the[ENTER]information about riding.

10173	Psst, have you heard? The Stable Boy’s memory can[ENTER]be wiped with a Scroll of Forgetfulness. This[ENTER]helps you increase your riding level more[ENTER]quickly! Do you want to apply the Scroll of[ENTER]Forgetfulness?

7800	Your horse doesn't need any more training. Try[ENTER]getting hold of the Armed Horse Book.
7801	Ride over to me.
7802	You have almost completed your training. Go off[ENTER]and explore the area on your horse. It might be[ENTER]more difficult this time but you can do it.

7809	It seems like your horse has evolved! But to me,[ENTER]you're obviously still a novice at handling[ENTER]horses.

7832	Here, for a little bit of cash they shall be[ENTER]yours.
7831	Who are you?
7833	You can choose one of these items as a reward:
7834	or %dx
7835	I'm not going to swap!
7836	Thank you! I already have %d Glyph Stones.
7837	What do you need these stones for?
7838	Good
7839	These stones were made in the times of the[ENTER]ancient empire - nobody knows how they are made[ENTER]any more.
7840	A lot of them have gone missing since then.
7841	I have discovered one of the old portals in the[ENTER]hinterland and am now searching for the stones[ENTER]that can help me to open them.
7843	However, I don't just need Glyph Stones, but I[ENTER]also need gold to channel the magic currents.
7842	Heuk-Young:
7844	However, I need more gold than I actually have.[ENTER]If you get hold of some gold for me, I'll give[ENTER]you this Dragon God Amulet.
7845	If you carry it with you, an Old Man or a[ENTER]Teleporter can directly take you to the blocked[ENTER]portal.
7846	You will get one if you bring me pure gold in one[ENTER]of these forms:
7847	Unfortunately you do not have enough gold to[ENTER]start the ritual. I need more pure gold:
7848	Perhaps another time.
7849	Here's some gold.
7850	Where? Unfortunately you don't have any pure gold[ENTER]with you. If you want a Dragon God Amulet, please[ENTER]bring me the following items:
7851	Give Heuk-Young:
7852	Nothing
7854	That's very kind of you! Here, as I promised, the[ENTER]amulet is yours.
7853	My name is Heuk-Young. I'm an annalist and I'm in[ENTER]charge of our people's ancient records. The first[ENTER]transcripts tell the story of the founding of the[ENTER]three kingdoms:
7855	If you carry the Dragon God Amulet with you, an[ENTER]Old Man or a teleporter takes you to the vicinity[ENTER]of the portal.
7856	Ah, I see you already have an amulet. But thank[ENTER]you anyway!
7857	I have already collected gold amounting to %d[ENTER]Yang.
7858	Our kingdom Shinsoo as well as Chunjo and Jinno.
7859	Our kingdom Chunjo as well as Shinsoo and Jinno.
7860	Our kingdom Jinno as well as Chunjo and Shinsoo.
7861	I'm investigating the ancient portals that used[ENTER]to allow people to travel to distant regions. We[ENTER]need special stones to open them.
7862	They carry special symbols. If you get hold of[ENTER]one of these stones, please bring it to me. I[ENTER]will, of course, reward you for it. See, this is[ENTER]what they look like:
7863	I have found some of those stones.
7864	Yes

11601	Preliminary Redux Investigations
11602	The Guardian of the Forest (RX) has been looking[ENTER]for you. Find him and listen to what he has to[ENTER]say.
11603	I'm back! I hope you didn't run into any[ENTER]difficulties while I was away? Well, I've[ENTER]examined everything that was written in the[ENTER]Spirit of the Earth. The Enchanted Forest of Dawn[ENTER]is not what it used to be, and the changes are[ENTER]far more alarming than I first realised. If we[ENTER]don't act soon, this place will be destroyed!
11604	I'd like you to help in the investigation.[ENTER]Please... will you join us?
11605	Excellent! Here's the situation. I have an Aid[ENTER]Kit here for my brothers. They're out exploring[ENTER]the region and have run into some trouble. In[ENTER]fact, some of them have recently gone missing.[ENTER]I've searched high and low for them, but they've[ENTER]disappeared without a trace. I can only assume[ENTER]they've been taken by a band of En-Tai Warriors.[ENTER]I've seen a number of them roaming around this[ENTER]area, acting very... strangely. Please, find out[ENTER]if they're responsible for the disappearance.
11606	You look very familiar... have we met somewhere[ENTER]before? Whatever. As you've no doubt heard, the[ENTER]Enchanted Forest is changing rapidly. We can't[ENTER]combat these new developments on our own. Will[ENTER]you help us? It would be fantastic if you could[ENTER]lend us your support!
11607	Kill Redux En-Tai Warriors.
11608	Kill the Redux En-Tai Warriors in the Enchanted[ENTER]Forest and return to the Guardian of the Forest.
11609	You've killed the Redux En-Tai Warriors. Return[ENTER]to Guardian of the Forest.
11610	You haven't found them anywhere? Hmm... Keep[ENTER]trying. You have to find the Redux En-Tai[ENTER]Warriors! Then come back and let me know what[ENTER]happened.
11611	Find and talk to the Guardian of the Forest (RX).
11612	You're back! Did you get anything from the Redux[ENTER]En-Tai Warriors?
11613	I've looked into everything, but didn't find[ENTER]anything of importance.
11614	Very strange. I was pretty certain my hunch was[ENTER]correct... Very well. I'll go over it in my mind[ENTER]once more and then call on you. Please wait until[ENTER]then.
11615	Find the Redux Aid Kit
11616	The Guardian of the Forest (RX) has been looking[ENTER]for you. Find him and listen to what he has to[ENTER]say.
11617	Welcome back, brave warrior! I was clearly[ENTER]barking up the wrong tree! Now I'm sure of it.[ENTER]This strange creature is responsible for[ENTER]everything. I assume it has used some kind of[ENTER]magic. As soon as it left, the Aid Kit[ENTER]disappeared as well. This magician, this warlock,[ENTER]this shaman or whatever the devil it is, he must[ENTER]be around here somewhere. Please, find him!
11618	Very good. I'll wait for you here! Just be[ENTER]careful.
11619	Find the Redux Aid Kit
11620	Kill the Redux En-Tai Druid and retrieve the[ENTER]Redux Aid Kit.
11621	You've got the Redux Aid Kit from the En-Tai[ENTER]Druid. Take it to the Guardian of the Forest[ENTER](RX).
11622	Do you need more time? They must be around here[ENTER]somewhere. I'm certain they're using some kind of[ENTER]powerful magic. Please, find them and bring me[ENTER]the Aid Kit.
11623	Find and talk to the Guardian of the Forest (RX).
11624	Let's see now. Yes, this is it! Now I can send[ENTER]the Aid Kit to my brothers. I owe you my deepest[ENTER]thanks. I'll never forget what great service[ENTER]you've done for me.
11625	We've been out here for quite some time already,[ENTER]and the supplies are gradually coming to an end.[ENTER]I'd better send this immediately. Let's see if[ENTER]anything else is missing. I'll call on you[ENTER]afterwards. In the meantime, take a load off your[ENTER]feet!
11626	Deliver the Redux Aid Kit
11627	The Scout of the Forest (RX) has been looking for[ENTER]you. Go and talk to him.
11628	Did you get chance to rest? Good. I've checked[ENTER]over the Aid Kit, there's nothing missing. Now[ENTER]it's high time we delivered the kit to my[ENTER]brothers. Please ensure you don't lose anything[ENTER]on the way!
11629	Very good. Be on your guard!
11630	Deliver the Redux Aid Kit to the Scout of the[ENTER]Forest.
11631	What are you still doing here? There are[ENTER]important medicines in that Aid Kit! Please, get[ENTER]a move on! It's required urgently!
11632	Who's there?! What do you think you're doing here?
11633	The Guardian of the Forest (RX) sent me. He[ENTER]wanted me to give you this.
11634	Oh! I do apologise. Please forgive my behaviour.[ENTER]Thanks for coming all this way and delivering[ENTER]this Aid Kit. These medicines are urgently[ENTER]needed! Before we do anything else, let me put[ENTER]this kit in a safe place. Just wait here for me a[ENTER]moment, will you?
11635	Sure, I'll wait.
11636	Secondary Redux Investigations
11637	The Scout of the Forest (RX) has been looking for[ENTER]you. Go and talk to him.
11638	I've sorry I made you wait for so long. How did[ENTER]you manage to find your way over here anyway?
11639	The Temple Guardian (RX) asked me to help out in[ENTER]investigating the Enchanted Forest. Can you tell[ENTER]me what needs doing?
11640	I admire your bravery.
11641	Many of the trees in this forest have turned to[ENTER]stone. These stones radiate a powerful and[ENTER]mystical energy which makes a tremendous noise.[ENTER]Please help me to destroy these stones.
11642	Destroy the Redux Stones
11643	You've destroyed all the Metins of the Tree[ENTER]Beings. Report back to the Scout of the Forest[ENTER](RX).
11644	What are you waiting for? If you don't set out[ENTER]immediately, there'll only be ever more Metin[ENTER]stones! Quickly, destroy the Metins of the Tree[ENTER]Beings or we're all doomed!
11645	Find and talk to the Scout of the Forest (RX).
11646	You did it! Fantastic! While you were destroying[ENTER]the Metins of the Tree Beings, I've managed to[ENTER]obtain some spores from the mushrooms. We'll have[ENTER]to see what use they are. But first we have[ENTER]another job to deal with.
11647	En-Tai Dew (RX)
11648	Find and talk to the Scout of the Forest (RX).
11649	Hmm... I wonder if this really is the legendary[ENTER]En-Tai Dew (RX) I've heard about? Legend has it[ENTER]that the people use this dew to drive out demons.[ENTER]Presumably it would be best if we obtained this[ENTER]chimeric liquid from the En-Tai Destroyers[ENTER]themselves.
11650	Could you get this dew for me? I'm sure you'll[ENTER]manage!
11651	Obtain En-Tai Dew (RX)
11652	Kill the En-Tai Destroyers and obtain 5 lots of[ENTER]En-Tai Dew (RX).
11653	You've obtained the En-Tai Dew (RX) from the[ENTER]En-Tai Destroyers. Deliver it to the Scout of the[ENTER]Forest.
11654	Did you manage to get the En-Tai Dew (RX)? Not[ENTER]yet? We're running out of time!
11655	Find and talk to the Scout of the Forest (RX).
11656	Did you find the En-Tai Destroyers and get the[ENTER]En-Tai Dew? So I was right! Thanks to your help[ENTER]we now have the En-Tai Dew. I'll be able to use[ENTER]that to stop the noise. Here, take this. It's not[ENTER]much, just a token of appreciation for your[ENTER]services. Now look for the Outrider of the[ENTER]Forest.
11657	Kill the Redux En-Tai Sovereign
11658	The Outrider of the Forest (RX) is looking for[ENTER]you. Go and find him and listen to the job he has[ENTER]for you.
11659	You must be the brave warrior the Scout of the[ENTER]Forest told me about. Ever since he mentioned[ENTER]your feats I've been waiting for you to appear![ENTER]Well now, listen to me very carefully.
11660	My duty is to patrol the forest. Lately I've[ENTER]observed how the En-Tai have become increasingly[ENTER]dangerous. They are a threat to each and every[ENTER]one of us. You need to kill their ruler!
11661	I would kill him myself, but after so many[ENTER]battles my sword is no longer sharp enough. Find[ENTER]the En-Tai Sovereign (RX) and bring me the Fine[ENTER]Timber from him.

11665	Talk to the Outrider of the Forest.
11666	Unbelievable! You actually managed it! First of[ENTER]all I should busy myself with investigating the[ENTER]%s. Will you wait until I'm finished?
11667	Obtain a Redux Tree Emerald
11668	The Outrider of the Forest (RX) is looking for[ENTER]you. Go and find him and listen to the job he has[ENTER]for you.
11669	You're back! I've been studying the En-Tai[ENTER]Sovereigns for some time, and was pretty sure it[ENTER]was Fine Timber that we needed. But I've taken a[ENTER]closer look at it and... well, unfortunately it[ENTER]isn't the stuff we need. Please return to the[ENTER]En-Tai Sovereigns once more.
11670	Is that really necessary?
11671	We need to find out where the king of the En-Tai[ENTER]Sovereigns (RX) is hiding. But they certainly[ENTER]won't reveal that information to us so easily.
11672	Kill the En-Tai Sovereign (RX) and obtain a Redux[ENTER]Tree Emerald.

11675	You did it! How fortunate I am to be able to see[ENTER]this with my own eyes! Well, time for me to try[ENTER]to tempt out a dryad and capture it in the Redux[ENTER]Tree Emerald.
11676	We did it! Brave warrior, take this. It's the[ENTER]Stone of the Dryads. The En-Tai Sovereigns[ENTER]protect the true King of the En-Tai with powerful[ENTER]spells. You'll only be able to confront Jotun[ENTER]Thrym if you're carrying this stone with you.[ENTER]Quickly now, find the leader of the Forest[ENTER]Guardians!
11677	You have received Fine Timber from the Redux[ENTER]En-Tai Sovereign. Return to the Outrider of the[ENTER]Forest and report.
11518	Preliminary Time Rift Investigations
11519	The Guardian of the Forest (TR) has been looking[ENTER]everywhere for you. Go and find him and listen to[ENTER]what he has to say.
11520	I'm back! I hope you didn't run into any[ENTER]difficulties while I was away? Well, I've[ENTER]examined everything that was written in the[ENTER]Spirit of the Earth. The Enchanted Forest of Dawn[ENTER]is not what it used to be, and the changes are[ENTER]far more alarming than I first realised. If we[ENTER]don't act soon, this place will be destroyed!
11521	I'd like you to help in the investigation.[ENTER]Please... will you join us?
11522	Yes, of course.
11523	Excellent! Here's the situation. I have an Aid[ENTER]Kit here for my brothers. They're out exploring[ENTER]the region and have run into some trouble. In[ENTER]fact, some of them have recently gone missing.[ENTER]I've searched high and low for them, but they've[ENTER]disappeared without a trace. I can only assume[ENTER]they've been taken by a band of En-Tai Warriors.[ENTER]I've seen a number of them roaming around this[ENTER]area, acting very... strangely. Please, find out[ENTER]if they're responsible for the disappearance.
11524	You look very familiar... have we met somewhere[ENTER]before? Whatever. As you've no doubt heard, the[ENTER]Enchanted Forest is changing rapidly. We can't[ENTER]combat these new developments on our own. Will[ENTER]you help us? It would be fantastic if you could[ENTER]lend us your support!
11525	Kill Time Rift En-Tai Warriors.
11526	Kill the Time Rift En-Tai Warriors in the[ENTER]Enchanted Forest and return to the Guardian of[ENTER]the Forest.
11527	You've killed the Time Rift En-Tai Warriors.[ENTER]Return to Guardian of the Forest.
11528	You haven't found them anywhere? Hmm... Keep[ENTER]trying. You have to find the Time Rift En-Tai[ENTER]Warriors! Then come back and let me know what[ENTER]happened.
11529	Find and talk to the Guardian of the Forest (TR).
11530	You're back! Did you get anything from the Time[ENTER]Rift En-Tai Warriors?
11531	I've looked into everything, but didn't find[ENTER]anything of importance.
11532	Very strange. I was pretty certain my hunch was[ENTER]correct... Very well. I'll go over it in my mind[ENTER]once more and then call on you. Please wait until[ENTER]then.
11533	Find the Time Rift Aid Kit
11534	The Guardian of the Forest (TR) has been looking[ENTER]for you. Find him and listen to what he has to[ENTER]say.
11535	Welcome back, brave warrior! I was clearly[ENTER]barking up the wrong tree! Now I'm sure of it.[ENTER]This strange creature is responsible for[ENTER]everything. I assume it has used some kind of[ENTER]magic. As soon as it left, the Aid Kit[ENTER]disappeared as well. This magician, this warlock,[ENTER]this shaman or whatever the devil it is, he must[ENTER]be around here somewhere. Please, find him!
11536	Excellent. I'll wait for you here! Just be[ENTER]careful.
11537	Find the Time Rift Aid Kit
11538	Kill the Time Rift En-Tai Druid and retrieve the[ENTER]Time Rift Aid Kit.
11539	You've got the Time Rift Aid Kit from the En-Tai[ENTER]Druid. Take it to the Guardian of the Forest[ENTER](TR).
11540	Do you need more time? They must be around here[ENTER]somewhere. I'm certain they're using some kind of[ENTER]powerful magic. Please, find them and bring me[ENTER]the Aid Kit.
11541	Find and talk to the Guardian of the Forest (TR).
11542	Let's see now. Yes, this is it! Now I can send[ENTER]the Aid Kit to my brothers. I owe you my deepest[ENTER]thanks. I'll never forget what great service[ENTER]you've done for me.
11543	We've been out here for quite some time already,[ENTER]and the supplies are gradually coming to an end.[ENTER]I'd better send this immediately. Let's see if[ENTER]anything else is missing. I'll call on you[ENTER]afterwards. In the meantime, take a load off your[ENTER]feet!
11544	Deliver the Time Rift Aid Kit
11545	The Guardian of the Forest (TR) has been looking[ENTER]for you. Find him and listen to what he has to[ENTER]say.
11546	Did you get chance to rest? Good. I've checked[ENTER]over the Aid Kit, there's nothing missing. Now[ENTER]it's high time we delivered the kit to my[ENTER]brothers. Please ensure you don't lose anything[ENTER]on the way!
11547	Very good. Be on your guard!
11548	Deliver the Time Rift Aid Kit to the Scout of the[ENTER]Forest.
11549	What are you still doing here? There are[ENTER]important medicines in that Aid Kit! Please, get[ENTER]a move on! It's required urgently!
11550	Who's there?! What do you think you're doing here?
11551	The Guardian of the Forest (TR) sent me. He[ENTER]wanted me to give you this.
11552	Oh! I do apologise. Please forgive my behaviour.[ENTER]Thanks for coming all this way and delivering[ENTER]this Aid Kit. These medicines are urgently[ENTER]needed! Before we do anything else, let me put[ENTER]this kit in a safe place. Just wait here for me a[ENTER]moment, will you?
11553	Sure, I'll wait.
11554	Secondary Time Rift Investigations
11555	The Scout of the Forest (TR) has been looking for[ENTER]you. Go and talk to him.
11556	I've sorry I made you wait for so long. How did[ENTER]you manage to find your way over here anyway?
11557	The Temple Guardian (TR) asked me to help out in[ENTER]investigating the Enchanted Forest. Can you tell[ENTER]me what needs doing?
11558	I admire your bravery.
11559	Many of the trees in this forest have turned to[ENTER]stone. These stones radiate a powerful and[ENTER]mystical energy which makes a tremendous noise.[ENTER]Please help me to destroy these stones.
11560	Destroy the Time Rift Stones
11561	You've destroyed all the Metins of the Tree[ENTER]Beings. Report back to the Scout of the Forest[ENTER](TR).
11562	What are you waiting for? If you don't set out[ENTER]immediately, there'll only be ever more Metin[ENTER]stones! Quickly, destroy the Metins of the Tree[ENTER]Beings or we're all doomed!
11563	Find and talk to the Scout of the Forest (TR).
11564	You did it! Fantastic! While you were destroying[ENTER]the Metins of the Tree Beings, I've managed to[ENTER]obtain some spores from the mushrooms. We'll have[ENTER]to see what use they are. But first we have[ENTER]another job to deal with.
11595	Remaining
11596	You have received %s experience points.
11565	En-Tai Dew (TR)
11566	Find and talk to the Scout of the Forest (TR).
11567	Hmm... I wonder if this really is the legendary[ENTER]En-Tai Dew I've heard about? Legend has it that[ENTER]the people use this dew to drive out demons.[ENTER]Presumably it would be best if we obtained this[ENTER]chimeric liquid from the En-Tai Destroyers[ENTER]themselves.
11568	Could you get this dew for me? I'm sure you'll[ENTER]manage!
11569	Obtain En-Tai Dew (TR)
11570	Kill the En-Tai Destroyers and obtain 5 lots of[ENTER]En-Tai Dew (TR).
11571	You've obtained the En-Tai Dew (TR) from the[ENTER]En-Tai Destroyers. Deliver it to the Scout of the[ENTER]Forest.
11572	Did you manage to get the En-Tai Dew (TR)? Not[ENTER]yet? We're running out of time!
11573	Find and talk to the Scout of the Forest (TR).
11574	Did you find the En-Tai Destroyers and get the[ENTER]En-Tai Dew? So I was right! Thanks to your help[ENTER]we now have the En-Tai Dew. I'll be able to use[ENTER]that to stop the noise. Here, take this. It's not[ENTER]much, just a token of appreciation for your[ENTER]services. Now look for the Outrider of the[ENTER]Forest.
11598	Remaining
11575	Kill the Time Rift En-Tai Sovereign
11576	The Outrider of the Forest (TR) is looking for[ENTER]you. Go and find him and listen to the job he has[ENTER]for you.

11578	My duty is to patrol the forest. Lately I've[ENTER]observed how the En-Tai have become increasingly[ENTER]dangerous. They are a threat to each and every[ENTER]one of us. You need to kill their ruler!
11579	I would kill him myself, but after so many[ENTER]battles my sword is no longer sharp enough. Find[ENTER]the En-Tai Sovereign (TR) and bring me the Fine[ENTER]Timber from him.
11580	Kill the Time Rift En-Tai Sovereign and collect[ENTER]some Fine Timber.
11581	You have received Fine Timber from the Time Rift[ENTER]En-Tai Sovereign. Return to the Outrider of the[ENTER]Forest and report.

You'll only be able to confront Jotun[ENTER]Thrym if you're carrying this stone with you.[ENTER]Quickly now, find the leader of the Forest[ENTER]Guardians!

8223	The Lost Present
8224	I was collecting mushrooms. There was a wolf[ENTER]standing right in front of me! The terrible beast[ENTER]bared its teeth and I ran away as fast as my legs[ENTER]could carry me. I lost the magical blue circlet[ENTER]that I was going to give my child as a gift along[ENTER]the way!
8225	Can you help me look for the circlet?
8226	I don't dare to leave the village for fear of[ENTER]those beasts. The fear still chills me to the[ENTER]bone.
8227	Yes, of course.
8228	No, not right now.
8229	No? Oh. But of course I understand that you have[ENTER]more important things to do than to help a poor,[ENTER]defenceless woman...
8230	Really? That's very brave of you! You just have[ENTER]to chase off a few wolves, then you're certain to[ENTER]find the blue circlet!
8231	Defeat the beasts nearby to find the blue circlet!
8232	You really did find it! Oh, my child will be so[ENTER]happy. Here, please accept this reward.
8233	You didn't find it? It has to be somewhere.[ENTER]Please don't give up yet!

8235	Found blue circlet. Take it to Ah-Yu.
8236	Back to the first floor
8237	Pung-Ho:
8238	Do you really want to return to the first floor?
8239	A wise decision. It is too dangerous to stay up[ENTER]here any longer. Go tend to your wounds.
8240	Suit yourself...[ENTER]But be careful![ENTER]It's very dangerous up here.
8242	You mean to tell me that you didn't feel[ENTER]confident enough to go into the Spider Dungeon?[ENTER]You are an experienced warrior with sophisticated[ENTER]technical ability - a few creepy crawlies[ENTER]shouldn't pose any kind of problem for you. But[ENTER]you do know that you need the Passage Ticket to[ENTER]enter the cavern, right?
8241	Access to the Breeding Lair
8243	New Danger
8244	You have made an exact replica of the[ENTER]inscription. Show it to the Captain.
8245	Great, you did it! Show me it then... Hmm. These[ENTER]characters are not known to me, I cannot[ENTER]understand a single word. You should ask the[ENTER]advice of Uriel the scholar.
8246	Head to the scholar Uriel and show him the[ENTER]inscription. He will certainly be able to[ENTER]translate it.
8247	The Captain is asking me to decipher this[ENTER]mysterious inscription? Naturally. I do love a[ENTER]good challenge. Pass it here.[ENTER]That is... well that is just terrible! Here, I'll[ENTER]write the translation down on this paper.[ENTER]Take it to the Captain as fast as you can and[ENTER]then return to me. If what is written here is[ENTER]true, then we are all in great danger! Go, go!
8248	You've not been to the Captain yet?! Please! You[ENTER]must hurry. We have no time to lose. He needs to[ENTER]read this letter!
8249	Deliver Uriel's letter
8250	That pig-headed old man... is a thank-you too[ENTER]much to ask for?! Very well. He said the[ENTER]information was extremely important, so I had[ENTER]better take it to the Captain as soon as[ENTER]possible.
8251	Uriel's letter
8253	Oh no! If what is written here is true, then a[ENTER]dangerous arachnid demon has set its web within[ENTER]the third floor of the Spider Dungeon - the[ENTER]Spider Baroness. The inscription reads that you[ENTER]need a special key in order to get to this hidden[ENTER]cavern. Go first to Uriel and ask him about this[ENTER]key. Then get yourself a troop together and storm[ENTER]this Spider Baroness' hideout! Here, I have[ENTER]another Passage Ticket for you too.
8252	This gate can only be opened by the Arachnids Key.
8254	The Arachnids Key
8255	I should seek out Uriel as soon as I can.
8256	Ah, you are back. Then I assume the Captain has[ENTER]issued you with the order to destroy the Spider[ENTER]Baroness? However the entrance to the Baroness'[ENTER]Breeding Lair is sealed and can only be opened[ENTER]with the Arachnids Key. Producing this key is[ENTER]very labour intensive. But if you bring me a[ENTER]Spider's Poison Sack, a Spider Egg Sack, a Spider[ENTER]Web, Spider Eyes, Spider Legs as well as the[ENTER]Spider Queen's Poison, I will make one for you.
8257	You want me to make you an Arachnids Key? To do[ENTER]so, I need a Spider's Poison Sack, a Spider Egg[ENTER]Sack, a Spider Web, Spider Eyes, Spider Legs as[ENTER]well as the Spider Queen's Poison. Did you find[ENTER]all these substances?
8258	Fantastic! You have all the things I need to make[ENTER]the Arachnids Key. Please wait a moment. It[ENTER]shouldn't take too long to make...
8259	Ha, finished! Here, your Arachnids Key. It will[ENTER]give you access to the Spider Baroness' hideout.[ENTER]I wish you and your comrades the best of success[ENTER]in the fight against this long-legged beast! But[ENTER]you have to hurry - the key is very unstable.[ENTER]After 24 hours it will fall apart back into its[ENTER]component pieces.
8260	Oh, oh... I'm afraid to say no one is born a[ENTER]master. You must understand that forging this key[ENTER]is extremely complicated. Even the tiniest of[ENTER]errors will lead to a failed attempt.[ENTER]Unfortunately I have lost all of the spider[ENTER]substances you collected for me in the creation[ENTER]process. The next attempt will work for sure!
8261	Something is still missing, I can't make you the[ENTER]Arachnids Key just yet. Here's a reminder of what[ENTER]we need: a Spider's Poison Sack, a Spider Egg[ENTER]Sack, a Spider Web, Spider Eyes, Spider Legs as[ENTER]well as the Spider Queen's Poison.

8269	The warrior who entered the cavern before you can[ENTER]start moving again after ten seconds have passed.[ENTER]Please wait a moment.
8270	Would you like to start a conquest? You will have[ENTER]20 minutes to complete it. Before this time ends,[ENTER]no one will be able to leave the Baroness'[ENTER]Breeding Lair.[ENTER]A renewed conquest attempt can be carried out[ENTER]after one hour has passed.
8271	You need the Arachnids Key to open the entrance.
8272	Only the leader of the group can use the[ENTER]Arachnids Key.
8274	The Spider Baroness has been defeated! In three[ENTER]minutes all warriors will be teleported out of[ENTER]the cavern.

8275	That didn't work. Please try it again!
8276	Warning: the Spider Baroness is getting angry![ENTER]Her attacks will be stronger, but she has also[ENTER]lowered her defence.
8277	Spider Dungeon 3
8278	Ah, good that you are here. I have important[ENTER]information for you: a scouting troop has[ENTER]uncovered a third floor in the Spider Dungeon.[ENTER]There are supposed to be some extremely monstrous[ENTER]and treacherous spiders nested there. On top of[ENTER]this, my men found an old gravestone with an[ENTER]inscription, but they were unable to make a copy[ENTER]of it. Go on the hunt for this stone and bring me[ENTER]a copy of this inscription. Here, this Passage[ENTER]Ticket will allow you to access the Spider[ENTER]Dungeon unhindered.
8279	The Inscription
8280	On the third floor of the Spider Dungeon you will[ENTER]find an old gravestone with an inscription[ENTER]engraved on it. Make a copy of this and bring it[ENTER]to the Captain.
8281	Perfect, you found the old gravestone and made a[ENTER]copy of the inscription on it! Head back to the[ENTER]Captain and show him.

8335	General Store Saleswoman:[ENTER]He said that? Are you sure? That doesn't sound[ENTER]like my father... Could you please ask him again?[ENTER]I really don't think he meant that dish.
8336	The Dinner
8337	The Dinner
8338	Go to the General Store Saleswoman. She could use[ENTER]your help.
8340	Open shop
8339	You know that the Armour Shop Dealer is my[ENTER]father, don't you? I want to prepare dinner for[ENTER]him, but I don't know what he wants to eat.[ENTER]Could you ask him what he would like to have?[ENTER]I will reward you for your time.
8341	The Saleswoman at the General Store wants to know[ENTER]what her father, the Armour Shop Dealer, would[ENTER]like to have for dinner.
8342	Go to the Armour Shop Dealer and ask him.
8343	Welcome![ENTER]I produce armour to protect you from attacks with[ENTER]knives and swords.
8344	Oh, my daughter sent you? She wants to know what[ENTER]she should cook tonight? Let me think.[ENTER]Mmmhhh, I'd like to have a Hotpot with venison,[ENTER]bear, cabbage and two eggs. That's what I'm[ENTER]really craving!
8345	The dinner
8346	The Saleswoman at the General Store would like to[ENTER]know what her father, the Armour Shop Dealer,[ENTER]wants for dinner.
8347	Go back to her and tell her what you have found[ENTER]out.
8349	Go back to Baek-Go.
8348	Ingredient for the medicine
8350	You have found the liver. Take it to Baek-Go.
8351	Thank you. We owe you!
8352	The patients will praise you.
8353	Here, take this as a reward. I'm sure you'll need[ENTER]it one day.
8354	You have received 3,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 5,000 Yang.[ENTER]You have received some Wolf Fur.
8355	Ingredient for the Medicine
8356	Ingredient for the Medicine
8357	Baek-Go is missing an important ingredient for[ENTER]the medicine.
8358	Go to him, he needs your assistance!
8359	Could you help me? Since the Metin Stones started[ENTER]falling from the sky, an unknown disease has[ENTER]started spreading. A lot of doctors have been[ENTER]working on a remedy, but they're still missing an[ENTER]ingredient to produce the medicine. There are[ENTER]wild animals outside the village, so we can't[ENTER]move freely there.
8360	Could you get me the ingredient for the medicine?[ENTER]I'm asking you because you're a soldier. I need a[ENTER]Blue Wolf's Liver for the medicine.
8361	Please bring me a Blue Wolf's Liver. Let me know[ENTER]once you've got it.
8362	Since the Metin Stones started falling down, an[ENTER]unknown disease has started to spread. Baek-Go[ENTER]needs a Blue Wolf's Liver to produce a remedy.[ENTER]Take the liver to him.
8363	How do I get a Wolf Liver?
8364	There's only one way to get hold of a Wolf Liver:[ENTER]You have to hunt Blue Wolves.
8365	I feel sorry for the wolves, but we need the[ENTER]liver for the remedy. Thanks in advance.
8366	Return to Baek-Go
8368	You have a long road ahead of you. Take care of[ENTER]yourself! And don't forget: You have to use the[ENTER]portal by the blue dot.
8367	How is Deokbae?
8369	Go and deliver the Letter from the Blacksmith to[ENTER]Deokbae, the lumberjack. You'll find him in the[ENTER]second village which you can only get to via the[ENTER]portal.
8370	A Letter from the Blacksmith
8371	Find Deokbae the lumberjack.
8372	A Letter from the Blacksmith
8373	Deokbae the lumberjack:
8374	Welcome. I have some good axes here. Do you want[ENTER]to buy one? You don't need an axe? Then why are[ENTER]you here? Ah, a Letter from the Blacksmith. Thank[ENTER]you. I'm a lumberjack, but I also sell pick axes[ENTER]and other tools. Sometimes I order some tools[ENTER]from him. That's how we became good friends.
8375	I should really go have a drink with him in the[ENTER]Seo-Pyung Bar. Thanks for bringing me the letter.[ENTER]Send my best wishes to the Blacksmith.
8376	A Letter from the Blacksmith? Man, it has been a[ENTER]long time. Where is it? You didn't lose it on the[ENTER]way here, did you?
8377	Here it is.
8379	Oh, I don't have it.
8378	Hey there, adventurer! I'd like to ask you a[ENTER]favour. Do you know a guy called Deokbae? He's a[ENTER]lumberjack and a good friend of mine. Perhaps[ENTER]it's a bit boring, but he really is one of the[ENTER]last hard working lumberjacks out there.
8380	Quit quest?
8381	That's nice. Come back soon.
8382	You lost it? Get out of my sight.
8383	Go back to the Blacksmith and get it. Don't lose[ENTER]the letter again though. Take care.
8384	Go back to the Blacksmith and claim your reward.
8385	Back to the Blacksmith
8386	I have delivered the letter.
8387	So, how is Deokbae? Hehe, he hasn't changed.[ENTER]Thanks. Take this as a reward. It isn't much, but[ENTER]it might come in handy one day. Thanks again.
8388	You have received 4,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 3,000 Yang.
8390	How is Deokbae?
8389	I haven't seen him in a while and I wrote him a[ENTER]letter to ask how he is. I would like you to[ENTER]deliver the letter to him. There are a lot of[ENTER]dangers in the village nowadays. So be careful.[ENTER]And don't bend the letter!
8391	How is Deokbae?
8392	The Blacksmith hasn't seen his friend Deokbae for[ENTER]some time. He wants to know how he is doing.
8393	Find the Blacksmith. Maybe you can help him.
8394	Oh, you don't know how to get to the next[ENTER]village? Press 'M' to view the miniature map.[ENTER]A blue dot will be displayed on it. This dot[ENTER]represents the portal that will take you into the[ENTER]adjoining area. The second village is also[ENTER]situated in this area.
8395	I will do it.
8396	No, thank you.
8397	Do you really want to permanently quit the quest?
8398	Come back soon.
8399	Well, that's too bad.
8401	That's nice to hear. Just come around again.
8400	A favour for Soon.
8402	Too bad. Now let me carry on reading.
8403	Really? I'm pleased! This is going to be a great[ENTER]book.
8404	Help for Soon
8405	Go to Uriel and ask him which fans are the best[ENTER]ones.
8406	List fans according to their attack values
8407	What brings you here? Oh the bookworm sent you?[ENTER]Every day he disappears with his books and[ENTER]scrolls, but he doesn't seem to get any more[ENTER]intelligent. And he's always disturbing me.[ENTER]Well, let's hear what he wants to know this time!
8408	He wants me to list the fans according to their[ENTER]attack values? That's rather easy: Heavenly Bird[ENTER]Fan, Triple Fan, Aquatic Fan and Crane Wing Fan.[ENTER]Got it?
8409	Back to Soon
8410	Return to Soon
8412	Go back to Soon and give him the information.
8411	A favour for Soon
8413	So, was Uriel able to give you a clear answer?
8414	Bird, Single, Aquatic, Crane Wing.
8415	Bird, Triple, Aquatic, Crane Wing.
8416	Bird, Double, Aquatic, Crane Wing.
8417	Oh no, I forgot it.
8418	Thanks a lot! Now I can continue reading. Thank[ENTER]you!
8419	You have received 6,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 2,000 Yang.
8420	I'm not sure if that's correct. Please verify it.
8421	Yes, it is correct.
8422	I'm not sure.
8423	Good to hear. Just come around again.
8424	That's not good to hear! Go away...
8425	Wonderful, that's great. Then come back again[ENTER]later.
8427	Are you sure that this order is correct?
8426	Soon:
8428	Yes, I am.
8429	No, I'm not.
8430	Good to hear. Come back again later.
8431	It would have been too good. Now go...
8432	Great, this is simply great! Thank you very much!
8433	A Favour for Soon
8434	A Favour for Soon
8435	Soon wants to ask you for a favour. But don't[ENTER]startle him. He's engrossed in his book.
8436	Aha... Hmhm... No, that...[ENTER]Yikes, where did you come from? How dare you[ENTER]disturb while I'm reading! Oh dear, sorry, I[ENTER]didn't mean to shout at you. Sometimes I come[ENTER]across something that I don't understand when I'm[ENTER]reading and that's just so frustrating.[ENTER]Could you give me a hand with something?
8437	I'm examining the fan weapons that are used by[ENTER]shamans. I'm having trouble trying to find out[ENTER]which ones are the best. I can't possibly test[ENTER]them all. Uriel, the scholar, knows all about[ENTER]these fans. Could you ask him for me? I'm[ENTER]interested in the following types of fan: Aquatic[ENTER]Fans, Heavenly Bird Fans, Triple Fans and Crane[ENTER]Wing Fans.
8438	I want him to list all fans according to their[ENTER]attack values.
8439	I'll do it.
8440	I won't do it.
8441	Do you really want to permanently quit the quest?
8443	Get out, now! Useless prowler...
8442	Ordering armour
8444	Thank you! Go back to the Blacksmith and ask him[ENTER]how he's getting on with the armour.
8445	Go to the Blacksmith and ask him how far he has[ENTER]got with the armour that the Armour Shop Dealer[ENTER]ordered.
8446	Armour for the Armour Shop Dealer
8447	What is it now? Why are you disturbing me? Oh,[ENTER]the Armour Shop Dealer sent you? That old man is[ENTER]very impatient. It's not that I don't want to do[ENTER]it. I just don't have the necessary materials for[ENTER]it. Could you get them for me? To produce the[ENTER]armour I need Iron Ore, Leather and Coal. You can[ENTER]get the Iron Ore from Uriel, the Leather from[ENTER]Octavio and the Coal from Yonah.
8448	I'll get the materials for you.
8449	No, not now.
8450	Are you sure you want to stop doing this quest?
8451	You can also do it later. But don't wait too[ENTER]long, this mission is urgent!
8452	Well, I suppose I'll have to get those things[ENTER]myself then. Take care.
8454	Then off you go again, so that I can get back to[ENTER]working in peace...
8453	Ordering armour
8455	Get materials
8456	Get the materials for the Blacksmith.
8457	Iron Ore - you can get that from Uriel.
8458	Leather - you can get that from Octavio.
8459	Coal - you can get it from Yonah.
8460	Uriel has given you Iron Ore.
8461	Octavio has given you the Leather.
8462	Yonah has given you the Coal.
8463	Go to Octavio.
8464	Go to Uriel.
8465	Go to Yonah.
8466	Iron Ore for Armour
8467	Thank you for bringing me my book back! Now I can[ENTER]continue my research. Here, take some Iron Ore.[ENTER]Use it well.
8468	You need Iron Ore? I can give you some. But I do[ENTER]have a favour to ask you: I recently lost a book[ENTER]while I was being chased by a pack of Wild Dogs.[ENTER]I think those Wild Dogs must have my book. Bring[ENTER]it back to me and then I'll give you some Iron[ENTER]Ore.
8469	Uriel will give you Iron Ore if you get his book[ENTER]back from the Wild Dogs.
8470	Iron Ore for Armour
8472	More Iron Ore? I've already given you some. Now I[ENTER]don't have any left.
8471	Could you help me? Thank you for doing my[ENTER]daughter a favour. I need to ask you for a favour[ENTER]now. I have asked the village Blacksmith to[ENTER]produce some armour, but I haven't heard anything[ENTER]from him. Could you find out how he's getting on[ENTER]with it?
8473	I need Leather.
8474	Octavio:
8475	Thank you for the Gall! Now I can finally get[ENTER]back to cooking my yummy meals. Mmm... Here, take[ENTER]this Leather as a reward.
8476	I can give you some Leather.[ENTER]However, nothing in life comes for free.[ENTER]How about a swap? I will give you the Leather if[ENTER]you get me a Gall.[ENTER]I often use Gall in my recipes.[ENTER]I won't mind if you're not interested.
8477	Octavio will give you Leather if you give him a[ENTER]Gall.
8478	I need Leather.
8479	I have already given you Leather. Did you lose[ENTER]it? I don't have any more.
8480	I need Coal.
8481	Thank you for the Clay. You scratch my back and[ENTER]I'll scratch yours: Here's your Coal. See you[ENTER]soon!
8482	What's up? You're here to get Coal? I have loads[ENTER]of Coal. But it doesn't come for free. You have[ENTER]to do something for me first.
8483	Yonah will give you Coal if you give him Clay.[ENTER]You can get this by hunting Red Wild Boars.
8485	I'm running out of Clay for my crockery. If you[ENTER]bring me some, I'll give you some Coal. It would[ENTER]be best if you kill some Red Wild Boars, as they[ENTER]believe it or not eat Clay. Thanks in advance!
8484	Yes, I'll do it.
8486	I need Coal.
8487	What? I have already given you Coal! Are you[ENTER]trying to trick me?
8488	I have all the materials.
8489	You seem to have no Iron Ore. Go to Uriel.
8490	Seems like you don't have any Leather. Go to[ENTER]Octavio.
8491	You don't have any Coal. Hmm, no Coal? Get some[ENTER]from Yonah.
8492	I have all the materials.
8493	Materials for the Blacksmith
8494	Go to the Blacksmith.
8496	The ordered armour
8495	No, I don't have any time.
8497	I have all necessary materials. Off to the[ENTER]Blacksmith.
8498	I've got your materials.
8499	You have already got all the materials?[ENTER]I'm impressed! Thank you, now I can deliver the[ENTER]ordered goods to the Armour Shop Dealer. Go tell[ENTER]him the good news!
8500	Tell the Armour Shop Dealer that his order will[ENTER]be finished soon.
8501	Go back to the Armour Shop Dealer.
8502	The Blacksmith will be delivering soon!
8503	Oh, so he'll be finished with the armour soon?[ENTER]Thanks for taking care of it. Take this as your[ENTER]reward.
8504	You have received 26,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 15,000 Yang.[ENTER]You have received a Pig Nose.
8505	You have received a Tiger Plate Armour+3.
8507	You have received a Crimson Suit+3.

8514	Yes, I want to.
8515	No, I'd rather not.
8516	Will you do it later? Come back soon, this[ENTER]mission is urgent!
8518	Wait a sec, I want to make sure that this is the[ENTER]right book... Hmm, yes, that's really fantastic.[ENTER]I'm definitely going to cook these dishes![ENTER]Thanks!
8517	The best cookbook
8519	Hmm, but I need... Wait, friend! Can I ask you[ENTER]for another favour? I have almost got all the[ENTER]ingredients for this fantastic dish, but I'm[ENTER]still missing a Grey Wolf Intestine. This[ENTER]ingredient isn't easy to get hold of and is best[ENTER]eaten when it's fresh. Please get me one!
8520	Get a Wolf Intestine for Octavio. You can get it[ENTER]from the Grey Wolves.
8521	I have got a Wolf Intestine.
8522	Thanks to you, I can finally cook this rare meal.[ENTER]This is going to be a feast! I'm really grateful[ENTER]for your help. Please take this modest reward.
8523	You have received 12,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 5,000 Yang.[ENTER]You have received a Wolf Claw.
8524	I still need a Grey Wolf Intestine. Please bring[ENTER]me one.
8525	The Best Cookbook
8526	The Best Cookbook
8527	Octavio is interested in a book which Soon owns.
8529	Go to Octavio and find out more.
8528	The best cookbook
8530	Hmm, is there any chance that you know Soon the[ENTER]bookworm, who spends his whole time reading?[ENTER]I have heard that Soon owns a good cookbook.[ENTER]Please find out if that's right. The cookbook is[ENTER]apparently full of rare and exotic recipes and I[ENTER]am keen to learn them.
8531	Ask Soon
8532	Ask Soon if he has a foreign cookbook.
8533	Have you got a special cook book?
8534	Bla, bla... Oh! You again! What do you want?[ENTER]Yes, I have a cookbook containing exotic meals.[ENTER]Take it with you if you like, I don't need it.[ENTER]But please don't disturb me when I'm reading!
8535	Soon has given you the foreign cookbook. Take it[ENTER]to Octavio.
8536	Here's the cookbook!
8538	Go to the Weapon Shop Dealer and ask him where[ENTER]you can buy Rice Cakes.
8537	Rice Cake?
8539	What do you know about Rice Cakes?
8540	Weapon Shop Dealer:
8541	What? Rice Cake? Is that a new weapon?! Yes, well[ENTER]then you can...[ENTER]Oh, you mean edible Rice Cakes. Why didn't you[ENTER]just say that in the first place? You'd better go[ENTER]to Octavio. He knows all there is to know about[ENTER]food.
8542	Rice Cake
8543	Go to Octavio and ask him what he knows about[ENTER]Rice Cakes.
8544	Hmm, Rice Cakes? The ones with the red cherries[ENTER]and the sugar on top? Yeah, I've eaten those[ENTER]before. You can get them from the rice cake[ENTER]seller in the next village. She's called Yu-Rang,[ENTER]I think.
8545	I don't have time for that!
8546	You have a long road ahead of you. See you next[ENTER]time.
8547	Well, you'll certainly be missing out. See you!
8549	You'll see, it's worth it. Have a good trip!
8548	Excuse me, could you please help me? My baby[ENTER]won't stop crying and I just don't know what to[ENTER]do to calm it down. My baby loves Rice Cakes and[ENTER]I think it might help. I think the Weapon Shop[ENTER]Dealer knows where to get some. Could you ask him[ENTER]for me?
8550	Find Yu-Rang
8551	Rice Cake
8552	Go to the Rice Cake seller Yu-Rang. You'll find[ENTER]her in the next village.
8553	Yu-Rang:
8554	Can I help you? Oh, Rice Cakes! Of course I can[ENTER]give you some! But... could you do something for[ENTER]me first? A boy named Taurean often comes here[ENTER]and annoys me, even though I never did anything[ENTER]to him. If you punish Taurean for me, I will give[ENTER]you some Rice Cakes, OK?
8555	Find Taurean
8556	Yu-Rang is always being teased by Taurean. Punish[ENTER]him and then she'll give you a Rice Cake.
8557	Why are you teasing Yu-Rang?
8558	What, who am I supposed to have annoyed? Oh, you[ENTER]mean the girl who sells Rice Cakes? No, I didn't[ENTER]want to annoy her! I was just bored and she[ENTER]looked nice and like she didn't have much to do.[ENTER]So I visited her a few times and wanted to play[ENTER]with her, but then she got angry...[ENTER]Girls are strange. I suppose I won't visit her[ENTER]any more then!
8560	Return to Yu-Rang
8559	Accept
8561	Rice Cake
8562	Taurean won't bother Yu-Rang any more. Go to her[ENTER]and pick up your Rice Cake.
8563	Ha, ha! You punished Taurean! Thank you. Now[ENTER]he'll think twice before he comes back here[ENTER]again. Here's your Rice Cake. Enjoy your meal!
8564	Back to Ah-Yu
8565	Rice Cake for Ah-Yu
8566	You have received a Rice Cake from Yu-Rang. Take[ENTER]it to Ah-Yu. You'll find her and her child in the[ENTER]first village.
8567	Here's the Rice Cake for your child.
8568	You brought me the Rice Cake! Thank you very[ENTER]much. Oh! Look, my baby has stopped crying now[ENTER]and is happily eating the cake. You did it.[ENTER]Thanks for your help!
8569	You receive 26,000 experience points.[ENTER]You receive 10,000 Yang.
8571	Rice Cake
8570	But... I can't leave this place and the baby is[ENTER]terrorising the whole neighbourhood... It won't[ENTER]take long! Are you sure that you don't have[ENTER]enough time?
8572	Rice Cake
8573	Ah-Yu really needs your help.
8574	Pay her a visit and find out what you can do for[ENTER]her.
8575	I guess you're busy?[ENTER]Please come back later.[ENTER]Don't cry, my child.
8576	I guess I'll have to ask someone else.[ENTER]Good luck on your journey!
8577	Thanks a lot! That's a real relief to me.
8578	Rice Cake
8579	Rice Cake
8581	Find the White Oath Soldier who stole the Golden[ENTER]Axe from the Blacksmith and take it back to him.
8580	Find the Golden Axe
8582	You have found the Golden Axe
8583	Here's the Golden Axe.
8584	Thank you! I'm in your debt. Now I don't have to[ENTER]worry about what to tell Deokbae when I see him.
8585	You have received 36,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 10,000 Yang.[ENTER]You have received an Ornament.
8586	Find the Golden Axe
8587	Find the Golden Axe
8588	The Blacksmith is looking for you! Someone has[ENTER]stolen his golden axe.
8589	Can you help him?
8590	The Golden Axe
8591	Do you remember my friend Deokbae? I promised to[ENTER]make him an axe. But unfortunately I wasn't[ENTER]paying attention for a few seconds and a female[ENTER]White Oath Soldier stole it from me. Can you get[ENTER]the axe back for me? A White Oath Soldier must[ENTER]have it. You should be able to recognise it.[ENTER]There aren't many of them. I'll give you a[ENTER]fantastic reward for doing it!
8592	Do you really want to permanently quit this quest?
8593	Blacksmith:
8594	I really want this axe! Will we see each other[ENTER]again? Goodbye.
8595	Thank you for your assistance. But be careful,[ENTER]that clan is very dangerous.
8596	Thank you for helping me. But be careful. The[ENTER]clan has been causing a lot of trouble lately.
8597	Find the Golden Axe
8599	Ask the Blacksmith where the Hairpin is.
8598	Find the Hairpin
8600	The stolen Hairpin
8601	What? She thinks I stole her Hairpin? That's[ENTER]unbelievable! Who does she think I am? I was[ENTER]working in my shop! Ah, I probably shouldn't tell[ENTER]you this, but the Weapon Shop Dealer was in the[ENTER]General Store Saleswoman's shop recently.
8602	The stolen Hairpin
8603	Ask the Weapon Shop Dealer about the whereabouts[ENTER]of the Hairpin.
8604	What? You think I stole the Hairpin from the[ENTER]General Store Saleswoman? No, never, I didn't do[ENTER]it! Honest! I was there to visit the saleswoman![ENTER]But she wasn't there. Instead I found a White[ENTER]Oath Archer. When she saw me, she ran away.[ENTER]Perhaps she stole the Hairpin.
8605	Get the Hairpin from the White Oath Archer!
8606	You have found the Hairpin
8607	Go to the General Store Saleswoman.
8608	I've got your Hairpin here.
8610	Oh, thank you very much. I'm so happy; I've[ENTER]finally got my beloved Hairpin back! You have[ENTER]already helped me so often! How can I ever show[ENTER]my appreciation? I have a Horse Riding Ticket. I[ENTER]know it's nothing special, but I don't need it[ENTER]any more, because I can't just leave my shop.[ENTER]Take it as a token of my gratitude.
8609	Please listen to me! I have a big problem. I left[ENTER]the shop for a moment to take care of something[ENTER]important. And while I was gone, someone stole my[ENTER]favourite Hairpin.
8611	You have received 60,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 10,000 Yang.[ENTER]You have received a Horse Riding Ticket.
8612	You haven't found my Hairpin yet? I hope you find[ENTER]it eventually.
8613	Quit
8614	Do you really want to quit?
8615	Yeah, they definitely aren't pushovers... Maybe[ENTER]you should take a rest and try again later?
8616	Where's my favourite Hairpin? Guess it didn't[ENTER]work out after all... good bye.
8617	Thank you very much. It really means a lot to me.
8618	Open shop
8619	Find the Hairpin
8621	It seems the General Store Saleswoman has lost[ENTER]her hairpin. She's pretty distraught.
8620	My father gave me this wonderful Hairpin for my[ENTER]birthday and I love it. But of course I can't[ENTER]leave my shop again, otherwise something[ENTER]important might be stolen from me. Could you look[ENTER]for my Hairpin for me? I suspect the Blacksmith.[ENTER]He mentioned once that he was looking for[ENTER]something like that.
8622	Go to her and see if you can help.
8623	Find the Hairpin
8624	I'll look for it.
8625	Do you really want to quit the quest?
8626	See you next time. Have fun!
8627	Where on earth is my Hairpin? Good bye...
8628	You'll look for it for me? Oh, thank you!
8629	Go to the Blacksmith
13539	You found the hairpin. Go back to the General[ENTER]Store Saleswoman.
8631	Ask Yu-Hwan about Mirine's brother.
8630	Find my brother
8632	Have you seen Mirine's brother?
8633	I fell in love without knowing what love[ENTER]means...Lalalaa...[ENTER]Who are you looking for? Mirine's brother? We had[ENTER]a quick talk before be went into the mountains to[ENTER]look for some rare herbs. I don't know where he[ENTER]is now. The village hunter often goes into the[ENTER]mountains. Why don't you ask him?[ENTER]La, la, la, love is sad but beautiful...
8634	Ask Yang-Shin about Mirine's brother.
8635	Mirine's brother? Yes, he was looking for herbs[ENTER]in the mountains. He was so happy when he found[ENTER]some rare herbs. He wanted to buy some new[ENTER]dresses for his sister with the profit he made[ENTER]from them. He's really nice. I'm sure he'll be[ENTER]back in a couple of days. Don't you think?
8636	Tell the news to Mirine.
8637	News about Mirine's brother.
8638	Look, I've received a letter from my brother! He[ENTER]has written that he found a place with lots of[ENTER]herbs and that it will be a while before he comes[ENTER]home.[ENTER]Sorry, I shouldn't have bothered you with this.[ENTER]Here, it's not much, but I hope you accept it and[ENTER]forgive me. Thanks for taking such a long journey[ENTER]upon yourself.
8639	You have received 122,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 5,000 Yang.
8640	Find My Brother
8642	Find My Brother
8641	 Find my brother.
8643	Mirine is worried about her brother.
8644	Go to her to find out more.
8645	Can I ask you for a favour? My brother has been[ENTER]gone for a long time. I haven't heard anything[ENTER]from him. I'm starting to get worried. Could you[ENTER]please look for him?
8646	My brother wanted to visit Yu-Hwan the musician[ENTER]in the next village. If you go to Yu-Hwan, you[ENTER]might get some news of my brother. Thanks in[ENTER]advance.
8647	Yes, I'll do it.
8648	Do you want to permanently give this quest up?
8649	Thank you. Please look for him. I'm really[ENTER]worried. See you soon.
8650	Too bad that you won't help me.[ENTER]See you.
8651	You're really going to look for him? Thank you[ENTER]very much, I am really worried. Good luck!
8653	Mi-Jung from the White Oath
8652	Kill Mi-Jung from the White Oath
8654	Go back to the Guardian.
8655	Mi-Jung from the White Oath
8656	Go and kill Mi-Jung from the White Oath. Once[ENTER]you're done, return to the Guardian.
8657	Go to the Guardian.
8658	You have killed Mi-Jung from the White Oath
8659	Return to the Guardian to receive your reward.
8660	I killed Mi-Jung.
8661	Oh! You really are as good as I had heard.[ENTER]Amazing. Thanks to you, it'll be a lot easier to[ENTER]deal with the White Oath problem now. Well done!
8662	You have received 122,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 20,000 Yang.[ENTER]You have received a Silver Bracelet.
8664	Kill Mi-Jung
8663	Come here for a second. You are a good fighter. I[ENTER]have heard a lot about you from the Captain.
8665	Kill Mi-Jung
8666	The soldiers of the White Oath are causing us[ENTER]real problems. Please get out there and eliminate[ENTER]them!
8667	Find the Guardian, he will tell you more.
8668	Could you go after Mi-Jung from the White Oath?[ENTER]It is hard to protect the village and its[ENTER]inhabitants from the constant White Oath attacks.[ENTER]If we kill Mi-Jung, one of their leaders, the[ENTER]situation will change. The safety of our village[ENTER]is in your hands. I trust that you won't fail!
8669	Yes, I'm going to do it.
8670	Not now.
8671	You really don't want to help us?
8672	I guess it's just not the right time. Come back[ENTER]later.
8673	If you don't want to help, there's nothing I can[ENTER]do about it. Just go...
8674	You really don't want to help us?
8676	Go to Ariyoung.
8675	Materials for making weapons.
8677	Go to Ah-Yu.
8678	The Weapon Shop Dealer needs your help. Get Iron[ENTER]Ore from Uriel and Linen from Ariyoung for him.
8679	Iron Ore for Weapons
8680	You need Iron Ore? I could give you some if you[ENTER]do me a favour.
8681	I dropped something when I had to run for my life[ENTER]from the tigers: It's a bundle containing[ENTER]important books, bound together with some cloth.[ENTER]If I don't have them, I can't continue my[ENTER]research on the Metin Stones. Bring me the[ENTER]Package and you will get some ore from me.
8682	I have your package.
8683	Thank you! I really ask you for favours far too[ENTER]often. Here, have some Iron Ore. I hope it[ENTER]fulfils its purpose.
8684	What? You need even more Iron Ore? It doesn't[ENTER]grow on trees, you know! I will give you some[ENTER]more Iron Ore, but you will have to do me a[ENTER]favour first. Tigers have stolen my Package. I[ENTER]had to run for my life and there were very[ENTER]important documents in it. If I don't have them,[ENTER]I can't continue my research on the Metin Stones.[ENTER]Please find the Package that the tigers stole[ENTER]from me.
8685	I already gave it to you. Did you forget that?
8687	Package found
8686	Material for weapons
8688	You have found Uriel's Package. Now go back to[ENTER]him.
8689	I need Linen.
8690	You need Linen? I've given it to Ah-Yu.[ENTER]Wait![ENTER]If you are going to see her anyway you can take[ENTER]this letter. We are good friends but because of[ENTER]her child haven't seen each other for a while.[ENTER]I'll also tell her that she should give you some[ENTER]of the Linen... Right, this helps everybody![ENTER]And give her my regards.
8691	Ariyoung:[ENTER]I'm sure you must have got Linen from Ah-Yu,[ENTER]didn't you?
8692	Ariyoung's letter
8693	A letter from Ariyoung? It's nice to hear from[ENTER]her after all this time. We used to meet for a[ENTER]chat quite often. But lately, it has been[ENTER]somewhat difficult. Please wait a moment.[ENTER]It says here you need some Linen? Ariyoung gave[ENTER]me some. I can give you some of it.[ENTER]Thank you for bringing me her letter. I will[ENTER]reply to her right away...
8694	Let's go to the Weapon Shop Dealer
8695	Go to the Weapon Shop Dealer.
8696	Give materials
8698	I have all the materials.[ENTER]Off to the Weapon Shop Dealer.
8697	Hey, could you do me a favour? I'm trying to make[ENTER]new types of weapons. It is not easy to find the[ENTER]necessary materials. I have lots of work to do[ENTER]and can't look for these materials myself.[ENTER]Could you get them for me?
8699	Well done. You are really good and very fast. Now[ENTER]let me work on these weapons![ENTER]*clank, clank*[ENTER]Here they are. These are the new weapon types.[ENTER]I did my best. I hope you like your new weapon.[ENTER]Have fun with it!
8700	Reward:
8701	You have received 122,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 20,000 Yang.
8702	You have received a Broad Sword+3.
8703	You have received a Scissor Dagger+3.
8704	You have received a Peacock Fan+3.
8705	Look for Materials
8706	Look for Materials
8707	The Weapon Shop Dealer is asking for your help.[ENTER]Go to him.
8708	Of course, I will reward you. As soon as the[ENTER]weapons are finished, I will give you one of[ENTER]them. I need the following materials: Iron Ore[ENTER]and Linen. You can get Iron Ore from Uriel and[ENTER]Linen from Ariyoung. Let me know when you have[ENTER]everything.
8709	Are you sure that you don't want to do this task?
8710	I guess it was too much for you.[ENTER]Come back when you have more time!
8711	If you don't want to, I guess it can't be helped.[ENTER]See you.
8712	Very good![ENTER]As soon as the weapons are finished, you will get[ENTER]one from me. Good luck.
8713	Look for materials
8715	Return to the City Guard
8714	Eun-Jung from the White Oath
8716	You have killed Eun-Jung from the White Oath. Go[ENTER]back to the City Guard and report back to him.
8717	You are fantastic! You're even better than I[ENTER]expected. We weren't able to do anything about[ENTER]those two leaders of the White Oath, and you[ENTER]defeated them both just like that.
8718	This is incredible. You shall receive an adequate[ENTER]reward. Please take this and continue to work for[ENTER]the peace of the village!
8719	You have received 150,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 25,000 Yang.[ENTER]You have received a Golden Necklace+4.
8720	Kill Eun-Jung
8721	Kill Eun-Jung
8722	The soldiers of the White Oath are nothing but[ENTER]trouble!
8723	Find the Guardian. He has a job for you.
8724	Come here for a moment.[ENTER]I have heard a lot about you from the Captain.[ENTER]You seem to be fearless.That's why I need your[ENTER]help again: The White Oath has been behaving[ENTER]worse than ever before.
8725	You have defeated Mi-Jung, the leader of the[ENTER]White Oath. But we are still in danger! The[ENTER]danger from the White Oath hasn't decreased but[ENTER]is worse than ever!
8726	To end this, we also have to eliminate the leader[ENTER]Eun-Jung. The rest of them should be no problem.[ENTER]Go and kill Eun-Jung! Our fate is in your hands!
8727	Guardian:
8728	Are you coming back later? You are the right[ENTER]person for this.
8729	You can't do it? Ah well. See you soon.
8730	I knew you would help us! Kill Eun-Jung, and[ENTER]we'll take care of the rest. Good luck!
8731	Kill the leader Eun-Jung. Hopefully the White[ENTER]Oath will be quiet then.
8733	Ask Yu-Hwan
8732	Looking for the armoured cavalry
8734	Go to Yu-Hwan
8735	Life is so wonderful - love is so wonderful...[ENTER]Oh, you again! What do you want now? Information[ENTER]about the armoured cavalry? Why are you asking me[ENTER]about them?[ENTER]The Captain must have grand plans?
8736	Yu-Hwan:
8737	Hardly any original texts from that time have[ENTER]survived but I know some songs about the armoured[ENTER]cavalry. Just a minute, I'll just tune my[ENTER]instrument...[ENTER]Oh, you are in a hurry? Nowadays nobody takes the[ENTER]time to listen any more...[ENTER]Oh well. Roughly speaking Isup's cavalry was[ENTER]almost invincible. Extremely well trained[ENTER]soldiers, heavy armour and at the same time fast[ENTER]and mobile.
8738	It was the best army this continent has ever[ENTER]seen. Many countries went under because nothing[ENTER]could stop the cavalry. It would be similar[ENTER]today. But you need tough training methods and a[ENTER]lot of high quality iron to set up such an army.[ENTER]You should ask the Peddler and Uriel the scholar[ENTER]about it. They probably know more details.
8739	Go to the Peddler
8740	The armoured cavalry
8741	Peddler
8742	Yu-Hwan the musician says that the Peddler and[ENTER]Uriel the scholar may have information about the[ENTER]armoured cavalry. First go to the Peddler.
8744	Peddler:
8743	The armoured cavalry
8745	What do you want from a simple Peddler like me?[ENTER]The iron armour from the armoured cavalry? Those[ENTER]are old stories. Who is interested in those? I[ENTER]have to earn a living and can't stand around[ENTER]chatting all day!
8746	It is getting more and more difficult to make[ENTER]ends meet. Since these stones have been falling[ENTER]out of the sky I have... What are you saying?[ENTER]Oh yes, the cavalry.[ENTER]As far as I know they wore special armours and[ENTER]producing them required special knowledge. They[ENTER]were the best armour ever made! Standard knives[ENTER]or even arrows could not penetrate this perfect[ENTER]armours!
8747	You can imagine how important the armours were by[ENTER]the money that was necessary to set up the[ENTER]cavalry. It is said that they used up the[ENTER]treasuries of entire kingdoms! If I was to sell[ENTER]such armours I'd be set up for life!
8748	Nowadays, armours can even be made out of Metin[ENTER]stones. With this new kind of armour, it's no[ENTER]longer just a dream to have an armoured cavalry[ENTER]like the one back then. But I'm talking too much.[ENTER]I have to get on. See you!
8749	The armoured cavalry
8750	The Peddler knew something about the iron armours[ENTER]of the armoured cavalry. Now go to the next[ENTER]village and talk to Uriel the scholar about the[ENTER]training.
8751	Uriel:
8752	What brings you here? The armoured cavalry?[ENTER]Of course I know something about them. Everyone[ENTER]does. This army will go down in history as one of[ENTER]the best of all times! A lot of what is being[ENTER]said may be exaggerated but these mounted[ENTER]soldiers were much feared. And quite rightly so.
8753	The armoured cavalry was superior to everyone[ENTER]else, mainly because of its intense training.[ENTER]Only the very best were able to finish the[ENTER]training, many of them died. I think if the same[ENTER]training was still done nowadays not a single[ENTER]soldier would be left by the end of it.
8755	I will give you some detailed information about[ENTER]the training, so that you won't be completely[ENTER]clueless. I know that some terrible wars are[ENTER]going on at the moment, but I'm not sure whether[ENTER]it is a good idea to set up a fearsome army like[ENTER]the armoured cavalry again.
8754	I have a new task for you. You have received the[ENTER]order to find out information about the armoured[ENTER]cavalry. It was the most important part of Isup,[ENTER]the king who unified the continent's army. The[ENTER]armoured cavalry was feared by other nations[ENTER]because of its remarkable speed and attack power.
8756	Go to the Captain and tell him everything you[ENTER]learned about the armoured cavalry.
8757	Go to the Captain
8758	Report about the armoured cavalry
8759	Captain:
8760	Have you been able to find something out? Do[ENTER]tell! ...[ENTER]Hmm, that's very interesting. So it's nothing[ENTER]more than heavy armour and hard training? Then it[ENTER]would be possible! Such an army could reunite the[ENTER]three kingdoms!
8761	But I would need a lot of money. And a lot of[ENTER]good blacksmiths. And recruits who voluntarily go[ENTER]through hell to become the best of the best![ENTER]No, no! Don't look at me like that. Don't worry,[ENTER]you have done enough for the time being.
8762	Here take your reward and have a rest.[ENTER]I'll see you later!
8763	You have received 150,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 30,000 Yang.[ENTER]You have received Golden Earrings.
8764	The Armoured Cavalry
8766	The Armoured Cavalry
8765	With the information you collected we may be able[ENTER]to strengthen our military power. Visit the[ENTER]musician Yu-Hwan first. I'm sure that he knows[ENTER]quite a bit about Isup's cavalry.
8767	Go to the Captain. He has a new task for you.
8768	Hm, as you like. See you later then.
8769	Will I ever command a cavalry regiment like that?[ENTER]Be careful.
8770	Thank you. Take care.
8771	The armoured cavalry
8772	The Captain is looking for information about King[ENTER]Isup's legendary cavalry. Yu-Hwan the musician[ENTER]probably has some information. Go and ask him.
8774	Talk to the General Store Saleswoman
8773	The story of Ariyoung's husband
8775	Go to the Saleswoman at the General Store and ask[ENTER]about Ariyoung's husband.
8776	Ariyoung's husband
8777	That's a sad story. She doesn't know what has[ENTER]happened to her husband? He is in a place that no[ENTER]one ever returns from...[ENTER]He was just on the way back to the village one[ENTER]day, when he was abducted and killed by the Black[ENTER]Wind Gang.
8778	She's going to be devastated when you tell her.[ENTER]They loved each other so much. But she has to[ENTER]find out. Otherwise the uncertainty will kill[ENTER]her.
8779	Sad news
8780	Ariyoung:
8781	The general store saleswoman has bad news. Go to[ENTER]Ariyoung and tell her about her husband's death.
8782	Your husband has died...
8783	What... what are you saying?! He... he was killed[ENTER]by the Black Wind Gang? Oh... no... he is dead...[ENTER]I don't know what to do without him!
8785	Would you please bring me my husband's body?[ENTER]Then I could at least say goodbye to him. Or if[ENTER]bringing back his body is not possible, just[ENTER]bring me a memento. I'm sure the Goo-Pae from the[ENTER]Black Wind Gang have something. Please bring me[ENTER]anything you can, as long as it belonged to him!
8784	Much time has passed since I last heard something[ENTER]about my husband. I am so worried. I hope nothing[ENTER]has happened to him. I know: There's not much use[ENTER]in worrying when you can't do anything about it.[ENTER]But my heart is beating so quickly, I just can't[ENTER]calm down.
8786	Yes, I'm going to help you.
8787	Please come back if you change your mind.[ENTER]Please...
8788	You didn't find anything? Well, thanks anyway...[ENTER]Oh, poor me!
8789	I can't express just how grateful I am. I'll pray[ENTER]for you.
8790	Kill Goo-Paes
8791	The Black Wind Gang has robbed and murdered[ENTER]Ariyoung's husband. Kill Goo-Paes until you find[ENTER]a memento of Ariyoung's husband.
8792	About your husband...
8793	How did it go? Did you find a memento of my[ENTER]husband? He meant the world to me. Anything at[ENTER]all?
8794	Not yet. I'll keep looking!
8796	Goo-Pae from the Black Wind Gang isn't an easy[ENTER]opponent. Go take a rest. Thanks for your help.
8795	The Saleswoman at the General Store might have[ENTER]heard something about my husband. She has lots of[ENTER]customers; maybe someone told her something.
8797	Then I'll have to wait for another hero who'll[ENTER]help me.[ENTER]Goodbye.
8798	Oh, you are so kind! Please, bring me a memento[ENTER]of my husband.
8799	Ariyoung's Wedding Ring
8800	Go to Ariyoung
8801	Go to Ariyoung
8802	You have found Ariyoung's husband's Wedding Ring[ENTER]on one of the killed Goo-Paes. You can't imagine[ENTER]a better memento.[ENTER]Take the Ring to Ariyoung.
8803	I have found this Ring.
8804	That ring... is... mine! Thank you so much! Now[ENTER]my husband can rest in peace. I'm going to bury[ENTER]this ring with a letter that I have written! From[ENTER]now on, I will be living alone. But at least I[ENTER]have his Wedding Ring again! That's a wonderful[ENTER]feeling. Thank you, thank you so much.
8805	Quest completed!
8807	News of you helping Ariyoung is spreading. A lot[ENTER]of people appreciate your help.
8806	I'm going to visit the Saleswoman.
8808	You have received 300,000 experience points.
8809	You have received 10,000 Yang.
8810	The Story of Ariyoung's Husband
8811	The Story of Ariyoung's Husband
8812	Ariyoung can't find her husband.
8813	Go to her and see if you can help.
8814	No, I don't have time for this.
8815	Are you going to give up this quest forever?
8816	Come back if you change your mind. Please...
8817	You don't have any time?[ENTER]No time for such an easy task?[ENTER]Okay, then...
8818	Thank you for your kindness. Aaah, where on earth[ENTER]is my husband...
8820	Look for a man who is reading poems and wearing[ENTER]rags and talk to him.
8819	Where is he hiding?
8821	Where is your husband?
8822	I don't know where could he be hiding.[ENTER]He's become so good at it, that it's really hard[ENTER]to find him. Should I really hang a bell on his[ENTER]neck, like the shop keeper recommended?
8823	Find Soon!
8824	You hear a wonderful poem. Enchanted by the[ENTER]words, you follow the sound of the voice until[ENTER]you find a man in rags.[ENTER][ENTER]This must be Aranyo's husband![ENTER][ENTER]You're just about to turn around, go back to[ENTER]Aranyo when he grabs your shoulder.
8825	You're not from around here. Did my wife send you?Oh no! He knows who I am! Should I tell him the[ENTER]truth?
8826	I was just passing by.
8827	Well...
8828	Aha. How nice to meet you. Wonderful weather we[ENTER]have today.[ENTER]Have you read a good book lately? I'm currently[ENTER]reading a book by Oja. I would highly recommend[ENTER]it.
8829	I'm right, aren't I? My wife's jibes are getting[ENTER]so bad that I cannot read in peace at home any[ENTER]more. She just doesn't understand me and keeps[ENTER]sending people after me... You found me here, but[ENTER]I could go somewhere else at any time.[ENTER]How about if you keep it quiet that you saw me[ENTER]here? I will give you some good hunting advice if[ENTER]you do.
8830	Return to Aranyo
8831	Go back to Aranyo and tell her that you could not[ENTER]find Soon.
8833	Soon's secret.
8832	Aranyo:
8834	You could not find him? I even laid out traps.[ENTER]Where the heck is he hiding? I'm so busy. What a[ENTER]sad fate I have.
8835	Return to Soon
8836	Go back to Soon and tell him you were successful.
8837	Here I am.
8838	Did everything go well? You saved my life! Take[ENTER]this, adventurer. As promised, here's your[ENTER]reward.
8839	You have received 7,000 experience points.
8840	You have received 10,000 Yang.
8841	Go back to Aranyo and tell her where you found[ENTER]Soon.
8842	Hiding is difficult.
8844	Thank you for not blowing my cover. It's not easy[ENTER]hiding from my wife. I just want to study here in[ENTER]peace.
8843	My husband really is a pain. He calls himself a[ENTER]scholar! And while we are fighting to keep[ENTER]ourselves fed, all he does is read books. Have[ENTER]you seen him? Why on earth did I have to go and[ENTER]marry a bookworm?
8845	Soon's whereabouts
8846	You found him?[ENTER]Thank you so much! If he finds out that you found[ENTER]him, he might run off again. I will go there[ENTER]immediately. This time I'll get him! And you get[ENTER]this as a token of my gratitude.[ENTER]Just you wait, sunshine...!
8848	Where Is He Hiding?
8847	I'll help you.
8849	Where Is He Hiding?
8850	Aranyo seems to be annoyed.
8851	Go to her and find out what the problem is.
8852	I don't have time for this.
8853	Do you really want to quit this quest?
8854	OK. Perhaps you could have a look for him later.
8855	Perhaps you might still find him...
8856	I would be very grateful. If you find a poor[ENTER]writer, let me know. He's probably the only one[ENTER]in the whole village. He could be writing a poem[ENTER]at this very minute and might want to be alone.[ENTER]When he finds out that I'm looking for him, he[ENTER]might try to flee. So be careful.
8857	Find Soon
8858	Find the bookworm
8860	Get a Wolf Pelt
8859	Find a feather duster
8861	Get a Wolf Pelt
8862	Get a Wolf Pelt so that the Old Lady can clean[ENTER]her house and so she won't have to cough any[ENTER]more. You can get one from the Grey Wolves.
8863	Return to the Old Lady
8864	Deliver Wolf Pelt
8865	A Wolf Pelt, that's great...Oh, no. This one's no[ENTER]good. Go back to the Grey Wolves. You might be[ENTER]able to find a better one.
8866	I need a real feather duster. Sorry, I can't do[ENTER]anything with this.
8867	I'll try again.
8868	I don't want to.
8869	Do you really want to quit this quest?
8871	Just come back later again.
8870	Cough! Cough! Oh dear, this cough will be the[ENTER]death of me. I have nothing to clean my house[ENTER]with, so all the dust is hanging around here. Oh,[ENTER]why don't I have a feather duster? My son took[ENTER]it, to work on some kind of weapon. My own flesh[ENTER]and blood is killing me!
8872	I know it is hard, but please try again anyway.
8873	Thank you for taking care of it.
8874	You're the adventurer that was here recently![ENTER]How does my cough sound? Cough, cough! As you can[ENTER]hear, it hasn't really improved. The house is[ENTER]still full of dust.[ENTER][ENTER]Oh? You brought me a Wolf Pelt? How magnificent![ENTER]You're very noble-minded. Wait a moment, I'll be[ENTER]back in a second.
8875	One, two, one, two. One foot in front of the[ENTER]other... Right, here I am again. Thank you very[ENTER]much! Finally, I can clean my house properly. I[ENTER]have also found something I would like to give[ENTER]you. I don't really know whether it's worth[ENTER]something but maybe it'll be useful to you.[ENTER]Thanks again. Farewell!
8876	A dusty something
8877	Your reward consists of a large, bulky item that[ENTER]is covered in layers of dust and is hard to[ENTER]identify. Curiously, you wipe the dust off it.
8878	It is old armour of very high quality, the work[ENTER]of an extremely talented blacksmith. How lucky!
8879	It's an armour. It is old but can still be used.[ENTER]Well, that's at least something!
8880	It is a set of armour, but despite all your hope,[ENTER]it's turned out to be completely worthless.
8882	You have received 15,000 experience points.
8881	I'll get you one.
8883	Dust to Dust
8884	Dust to Dust
8885	The Old Lady can't seem to shrug off her cough.
8886	Pay her a visit and see if you can help!
8887	Everything is dusty! I need a feather duster.[ENTER]Could you help me?
8888	It has been a while, but I think that my husband,[ENTER]may he rest in peace, made it from Wolf Pelt.[ENTER]Cough! Cough![ENTER][ENTER]Could you perhaps get a Wolf Pelt for a poor old[ENTER]lady? You can get one from a Grey Wolf. You would[ENTER]really be helping me a lot.
8889	Do you really want to quit?
8890	Too bad. I really thought you'd help me.[ENTER]Come again if you change your mind.
8891	What kind of reward could one expect from such an[ENTER]old, poor woman?
8892	It isn't easy to get a Wolf Pelt, but I'm going[ENTER]to try. After all, I want to become a great hero[ENTER]one day!
8894	Do you want to stop looking?
8893	Help Ah-Yu!
8895	It's okay, you can go. But come back when you[ENTER]have some time.
8896	You are a coward. You would run away anyway, if[ENTER]you came across the Savages! Now just go!
8897	Thank you for helping me. It's three Spears.
8898	The Spears
8899	Ah-Yu
8900	The three Spears
8901	You have found all the three Spears belonging to[ENTER]Ah-Yu's husband. Now go back to Ah-Yu.
8902	Look for the Spears!
8903	Savage Infantrymen, Savage Minions, Savage[ENTER]Archers and Savage Generals: They all have[ENTER]Spears. Look for the Husband's Spears amongst[ENTER]theirs.
8905	You have to find the three Spears and take them[ENTER]back to Ah-Yu.[ENTER](Number of spears: %s)
8904	Mementos of a husband
8906	Where can I find the spears?
8907	It's very likely that the Savages have my[ENTER]Husband's Spears. Who knows, hopefully they[ENTER]haven't sold them. They are very good Spears.[ENTER][ENTER]Are you going to continue looking for them?
8908	Yes, I'll continue looking.
8909	You are a coward! I suppose I can't do anything[ENTER]about it. I'll have to go look for myself.[ENTER][ENTER]Do you really want to give up the search?
8910	Yes, I give up.
8911	I would do it myself, but my baby needs me. Come[ENTER]again when you have found all the spears!
8912	You have given up looking for Ah-Yu's Husband's[ENTER]Spears.
8913	Thank you. I'm sure you'll find them soon!
8914	Return the Husband's Spears
8916	Ah-Yu:
8915	Oh, please don't cry any more sweetheart. Mummy[ENTER]has also got worries. If you carry on crying like[ENTER]that, we both won't be able to calm down. Please[ENTER]stop crying.
8917	You found one, that's great! But could you look[ENTER]for the other two too? They belong together. It[ENTER]also looks a lot nicer when they're all hanging[ENTER]up on the wall together... Thank you.
8918	I'll try again.
8919	I give up.
8920	You have given up looking for Ah-Yu's Husband's[ENTER]Spears.
8921	Thank you for not giving up!
8922	Oh, there they are! I'm very happy, thank you.[ENTER]It's not much Yang, but please accept it.
8923	You receive 300,000 experience points.[ENTER]You receive 20,000 Yang.
8924	The Spears
8925	The Spears
8927	Someone has stolen Ah-Yu's valuable spears.
8926	Oh, you seem a little down at the moment. You're[ENTER]usually so happy! Has something happened?
8928	Go to her and see if you can help.
8929	My husband used to look after me and made sure[ENTER]that nothing bad ever happened to me. But then he[ENTER]died in the war. The only thing that I have left[ENTER]of him is our baby and his Spears.
8930	While I was at work, someone stole the Spears.[ENTER]The neighbours said it was the Savages. I can't[ENTER]look for them myself because of the baby.
8931	Could you bring the Spears back for me? I'm sure[ENTER]the Savages have them.
8932	I'm going to look for them.
8933	I don't have time.
8935	Thank you, my friend![ENTER]I hope you are successful.
8934	 Balso?
8936	A medicine for Balso
8937	Go to Balso
8938	You found the medicine for Balso who caught an[ENTER]unknown disease from the Plagued Men. Deliver the[ENTER]medicine to him.
8939	Get the medicine
8940	During his long escape, Balso caught an unknown[ENTER]disease. Get the medicine from the Plagued Men at[ENTER]Mount Sohan.
8941	I've got your Medicine!
8942	Oh, thanks! Living the life of a fugitive is[ENTER]terrible. Especially when you also get sick.[ENTER]Fortunately I can recover from my illness now.[ENTER]Thank you so much.
8943	Reward:
8944	You have received 1,900,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 30,000 Yang.
8946	Balso the Traitor
8945	It's so itchy...
8947	Balso the Traitor
8948	Find Traitor Balso.
8949	Traitor Balso:
8950	Can I ask you a favour? As you might already[ENTER]know, I am generally known as a traitor around[ENTER]here. My life is very difficult now. I[ENTER]experienced times in which my life was really[ENTER]good. But now it's the complete opposite. Now I'm[ENTER]always on the run. This means that I am always[ENTER]contracting diseases.
8951	A few days ago I was at Mount Sohan and somehow[ENTER]got mixed up with a few Plagued Men. Luckily I[ENTER]was able to flee, but somehow I caught some sort[ENTER]of disease from them from touching their skin.[ENTER]Can you help me to get some medicine? I presume[ENTER]that they have some with them. I don't like doing[ENTER]this, but please, could you help me?
8952	Yes, I'll help you.
8953	Do you want to quit looking?
8954	Well, that's always happening to me. Everywhere I[ENTER]look there are people who don't like me. If you[ENTER]change your mind, come back again later.
8955	Go! And don't ever come here again! It's always[ENTER]the same...
8957	Thank you. I trust you! Bring me back the Axe[ENTER]quickly.
8956	Deokbae's Golden Axe
8958	Visit Deokbae
8959	Found the Golden Axe
8960	You got the Golden Axe from the Savages.[ENTER]Take it to Deokbae.
8961	Looking for the Golden Axe
8962	Bring back Deokbae's beloved Golden Axe from the[ENTER]Savage Generals.
8963	I've found your Golden Axe!
8964	Deokbae the lumberjack:
8965	Without your help I would have never got the Axe[ENTER]back. Thank you so much. I will take more care in[ENTER]future and always keep it with me.
8966	You have received 400,000 experience points.
8968	You have received 30,000 Yang.
8967	About your Golden Axe...
8969	Deokbae's Golden Axe
8970	Deokbae's Golden Axe
8971	Deokbae can't find his golden axe. Go to him and[ENTER]find out how you can help.
8972	Deokbae the lumberjack:
8973	Oh no, oh no! I have lost the Axe. Perhaps you[ENTER]know which Axe I mean? It's the Golden Axe I got[ENTER]from the Blacksmith. A Savage stole it.
8974	If the Blacksmith finds out about this he will be[ENTER]furious and refuse to repair my axes. Also it was[ENTER]a really good axe. Can you perhaps bring it back?
8975	Decline
8976	Do you want to quit looking for it?
8977	Oh, come back when you have some time.
8978	Too difficult for you? Well, I suppose there's[ENTER]nothing I can do. But be careful, the Savages are[ENTER]everywhere.
8980	Look for Yu-Hwan
8979	Please look for my older brother!
8981	Go to Yu-Hwan
8982	Mirine's older brother has disappeared again. He[ENTER]wrote her a letter some time ago, but since then[ENTER]she hasn't heard anything from him. Go to Yu-Hwan[ENTER]and ask him if he knows anything about Mirine's[ENTER]older brother.
8983	Have you seen Mirine's brother?
8984	Mirine's brother? I'm afraid I can't help you[ENTER]there. I haven't had any contact with him[ENTER]recently either. I can barely remember when I saw[ENTER]him last. I'm also worried.[ENTER]Perhaps something has happened to him? Go ask the[ENTER]hunter Yang-Shin. He's always on the move and[ENTER]might have seen him.
8985	Look for Yang-Shin
8986	Go to Yang-Shin the hunter
8987	The Hunter Yang-Shin is always on the move.[ENTER]Perhaps he has seen Mirine's older brother.
8988	Have you seen Mirine's brother?
8989	You mean Mirine's older brother? The last time I[ENTER]saw him he was on his way to the Valley of[ENTER]Seungryong to collect healing herbs. I was a bit[ENTER]surprised, because it's very dangerous there, but[ENTER]then I didn't really think about it any further.
8991	I should have stopped him. If he hasn't got in[ENTER]contact, something must have happened to him.[ENTER]You'd better go to the Valley of Seungryong and[ENTER]look for him.
8990	Why are you crying?
8992	Start search
8993	Do you want to quit looking?
8994	Mirine was really very sad.[ENTER]I'll come back later.
8995	If an older brother doesn't get in contact for a[ENTER]while, it doesn't necessarily mean that something[ENTER]has happened to him. You don't need to go into[ENTER]that dangerous valley, just because a little girl[ENTER]has asked you to.
8996	The mission is not as insignificant as it seems.[ENTER]The Valley of Seungryong is a dangerous place.[ENTER]But I promised, so I will do it.
8997	The missing brother
8998	Look for the older brother in the Valley of[ENTER]Seungryong
8999	Look for Mirine's brother
9000	Mirine's brother is looking for healing herbs in[ENTER]the Valley of Seungryong. Go there and see[ENTER]whether he is okay.[ENTER]The Teleporter will help you if you are looking[ENTER]for a short cut.
9002	The body!
9001	You once brought me a letter from my brother,[ENTER]didn't you? I was very grateful when you did[ENTER]that. Unfortunately I haven't been in contact[ENTER]with him since then. My brother is still away.[ENTER]He's looking for healing herbs for me.
9003	A dead man is lying here. He's young and thin and[ENTER]seems to have been collecting Ginseng. I'm afraid[ENTER]that it might be Mirine's older brother, who we[ENTER]have been looking for. The body is wearing a[ENTER]necklace with a pendant on it. I'll take it off[ENTER]and take it to Mirine.
9004	Go to Mirine
9005	Sad news
9006	You found a pendant on a body in the Valley of[ENTER]Seungryong, on which Mirine's name is engraved.[ENTER]Go to Mirine and give her the necklace and the[ENTER]pendant.
9007	Do you know this necklace?
9008	Oh, this necklace... My brother used to wear it[ENTER]all the time. I have a similar one. We always[ENTER]wore them so that we'd remember each other and[ENTER]find our way back to each other. But... my[ENTER]brother isn't here any more... And only the[ENTER]necklace has found its way back.
9009	My poor brother...[ENTER]And all just because of this war. My brother sold[ENTER]healing herbs, it was the only thing that brought[ENTER]any money in. It allowed us to buy food. He[ENTER]worked really hard so that I had enough to eat.[ENTER]And now he's dead. Just because of me...
9010	Thank you for bringing me this. Now I at least[ENTER]know what happened. If you hadn't helped me, I[ENTER]would never have found out.
9011	I'll take good care of my older brother's pendant[ENTER]and I'll give you the necklace as a token of my[ENTER]gratitude. I'm sure it'll come in useful.[ENTER]Thanks for your help. I'm sure he's in heaven[ENTER]now, don't you think?
9013	You have received 600,000 experience points.[ENTER]You have received 35,000 Yang.
9012	I'm worried about him because I haven't had any[ENTER]contact with him for so long. I'm sorry, but[ENTER]could you have another look for my brother?[ENTER]Yu-Hwan might know something.
9014	The Missing Brother
9015	The Missing Brother
9016	Mirine is worried about her brother. Go and[ENTER]comfort her.
9017	Decline
9018	Do you want to quit searching?
9019	Oh...[ENTER]I'll wait here. Maybe later? Please?
9020	I don't have time![ENTER]Good luck to your brother.
9021	It wouldn't be very nice to abandon a crying[ENTER]girl. And the mission won't take much time[ENTER]either. Let's go!
9023	Do you really want to give up the quest forever?
9022	Yu-Rang's Rice Cake
9024	If you have time later on, please come back. I[ENTER]don't know how we'll survive without selling the[ENTER]Rice Cakes.
9025	Everything revolves around the rich people who[ENTER]throw Yang out the window as if there was no[ENTER]tomorrow. When we don't even know if we'll have[ENTER]food on the table tomorrow! Go away!
9026	Thanks. You are very kind. I'll wait here until[ENTER]you are back.
9027	The stolen Rice Cake
9028	Get Yu-Rang's lost Rice Cake back from the[ENTER]Spiders in the desert. If you're too slow, the[ENTER]Spiders will eat the Rice Cake, or they will[ENTER]become terribly dry in the hot sun. Hurry up!
9029	Kill the Baby Spiders in the Yongbi Desert.
9030	About your stolen Rice Cake...
9031	What, the Spiders ate the Rice Cake? Oh no! Or[ENTER]has it dried up?! Please don't say that[ENTER]everything is lost!
9032	No, everything's okay.
9034	I give up.
9033	Your stolen Rice Cake...
9035	Can't you perhaps do it after all? The Rice Cake[ENTER]is very important to me. I beg you.[ENTER][ENTER]Do you want to give up the quest to find[ENTER]Yu-Rang's Rice Cake in the desert?
9036	I'm going to try again.
9037	Sorry, it's too difficult.
9038	I can't believe it. Who is going to help us now?
9039	Come on! Please help me!
9040	So you are going to continue the search? Thank[ENTER]you! Please try to find the Rice Cake as quickly[ENTER]as possible.
9041	No, it is too late. Even if you get hold of it,[ENTER]it would have dried up by now. I won't be able to[ENTER]sell it any more.
9042	You look at the ground and see the pieces of cake[ENTER]the Spiders have left behind. Unfortunately they[ENTER]are all dried up now.
9043	You wasted too much time looking for Rice Cakes.[ENTER]The Rice Cakes have gone stale. You have failed.
9045	Back to Yu-Rang
9044	Hey, how's your mother?
9046	Return to Yu-Rang
9047	You have rescued Yu-Rang's Rice Cake from the[ENTER]Spiders just in time. Take it to her.
9048	You are in luck. Here is your Rice Cake.
9049	You're really great! I don't know what to say.[ENTER]Now I can sell it on the market tomorrow. Thank[ENTER]you so much.
9050	You receive 900,000 experience points.
9051	You have received 25,000 Yang.
9052	The Stolen Rice Cake
9053	The Stolen Rice Cake
9054	When did you last talk to Yu-Rang? Exactly! Why[ENTER]don't you go see her now?
9055	Oh, she is feeling much better; thanks for asking.
9056	You look like you are in trouble. What's up?
9057	I sell Rice Cake here every day, but something[ENTER]terrible happened today. Gigantic Spiders[ENTER]appeared and stole it from me. I was terrified[ENTER]and didn't fight them. Now I don't have any Rice[ENTER]Cake left to sell. But how am I going to survive?[ENTER]My family doesn't have any other income...
9058	I'll find it for you.
9059	Sorry, I don't have any time.
9060	Question:
9062	What do you like?
9061	Huahn-So
9063	Well, ever since I lost my husband in the war,[ENTER]I've been feeling very lonely. Hm? What would[ENTER]make me feel better? Well, my husband used to[ENTER]bring me Flowers.
9064	They were Flowers that grow quite far away from[ENTER]our village. Even though it was dangerous, he got[ENTER]the Flowers for me. I can't see these Flowers any[ENTER]more though, as my husband is dead. But on days[ENTER]like these I miss him so much. Oh, what did I[ENTER]just say? That was very inappropriate. Please[ENTER]forget what I just said.
9065	Go back to Huahn-So
9066	Back to Huahn-So
9067	 Huahn-So 
9068	Ariyoung is missing the Flowers her husband[ENTER]always brought her. Go to Huahn-So and tell him[ENTER]about it.
9069	The gift for Ariyoung...
9070	So, what does Ariyoung like? You didn't tell her[ENTER]anything about me, did you? Hmm, she likes a[ENTER]Flower that her husband used to bring her?[ENTER]That's quite far away from the village. It's[ENTER]going to be difficult for me to get there. And[ENTER]there could be monsters there like tigers.
9071	Exactly! Why don't you help me? Why don't you[ENTER]just pick the Flowers for me? It would be a great[ENTER]help to us both. What? That's not part of the[ENTER]deal? Come on, don't you see how hard I'm trying[ENTER]to win her love? Just help me! I will reward you[ENTER]with lots of Yang!
9073	Refuse
9072	Oh my beloved Ariyoung
9074	Do you want to give up the quest forever?
9075	Damn. How am I supposed to get those Flowers?[ENTER]Please come back if you change your mind.
9076	Have you never been in love? Don't you know how I[ENTER]feel about Ariyoung? Oh Ariyoung...
9077	Thank you very much! Please bring me those[ENTER]Flowers.
9078	Get the Flowers
9079	Flowers
9080	Flowers for Ariyoung
9081	To help Huahn-So tell Ariyoung how he feels, you[ENTER]have to get special Flowers. The Flowers can be[ENTER]found in the corner of the map of the first[ENTER]village.
9082	I haven't found any Flowers.
9084	Hm, damn...[ENTER]I wanted to tell her my feelings. It's so hard to[ENTER]get her love. My dearest Ariyoung...
9083	Do you know Lady Ariyoung? Well, she is...no,[ENTER]well she was married. Her husband died a few[ENTER]years back and since then she has been living[ENTER]alone. She has very impressive personality and[ENTER]she is still a very beautiful woman. She married[ENTER]very young and I was too late... 
9085	I will try again.
9086	I quit.
9087	Do you want to give up the quest forever?
9088	Oh...[ENTER]If you change your mind...[ENTER]I'll be waiting right here.[ENTER]Please help me!
9089	Will my love end like this? Ariyoung...
9090	Thank you so much. You must also be in love, if[ENTER]you can understand what I feel for Ariyoung.
9091	Ariyoung's favourite Flowers
9092	These Flowers look like the ones Ariyoung[ENTER]described. I'm going to take some.
9093	Back to Huahn-So
9095	I have found Ariyoung's favourite flowers and[ENTER]have picked some. I should take them to Huahn-So[ENTER]so he can confess his love to Ariyoung.
9094	But her husband died in the war. That's why she[ENTER]is such a young widow. I want her to know how I[ENTER]feel! I know its a selfish request, but could you[ENTER]please help me?
9096	Here are Ariyoung's favourite flowers.
9097	Oh, these are the Flowers? Now I can tell[ENTER]Ariyoung how I feel about her! Do you think it's[ENTER]too early for that? Oh well, it doesn't matter if[ENTER]it's too early. I have to tell her otherwise I'll[ENTER]burst. Here is your reward and thank you very[ENTER]much!
9098	You have received 400,000 experience points.
9099	You have received 12,000 Yang.
9100	Huahn-So
9101	Huahn-So
9102	Go and pay Huahn-So a visit.
9103	Do you think she likes handsome men? Or beautiful[ENTER]clothes? I need to find out what she likes first,[ENTER]then I might be able to talk to her. Could you[ENTER]find out for me, please? But don't tell her[ENTER]anything about me! I beg you! I'll give a reward[ENTER]for doing it.
9104	Go to Ariyoung
9105	Go to Ariyoung
9106	Go to Ariyoung
9107	Huahn-So loves the widow Ariyoung. To help[ENTER]Huahn-So tell Ariyoung how he feels, you have to[ENTER]find out what she likes. Ask Ariyoung what she[ENTER]likes, but take care to not tell her too much!
9109	It's your loss. You're missing the chance of a[ENTER]lifetime.
9108	Go to the Storekeeper.
9110	Very good! I knew you would be interested. If you[ENTER]get some then come back here and please share[ENTER]them with me!
9111	Go to Octavio
9112	Ok-gu
9113	Go to Octavio
9114	The Storekeeper has given you a good tip: frog's[ENTER]leg soup is an excellent remedy for weakness and[ENTER]tired bones. Ask Octavio whether he can make this[ENTER]soup.
9115	Frog's leg soup?
9116	Frog's leg soup... Yeah right, I used to make[ENTER]that. But that's all in the past now. Back then,[ENTER]I wasn't afraid of monsters, so I was able to get[ENTER]hold of Frog's Legs easily.
9117	But now... I am too old and tired. With that[ENTER]soup, I could regain some energy, but frogs[ENTER]aren't easy to kill. If you brought me the Frog's[ENTER]Legs for the soup, I would make the best frog's[ENTER]leg soup in the world for us!
9118	Sure, I'll do it.
9120	No, I can't do that.
9119	How are you?
9121	Do you want to give up the quest forever?
9122	You're busy? Come back if you change your mind.
9123	My soup isn't very well known. If you knew what[ENTER]it was like you'd do it. Ah well, goodbye.
9124	Then hurry up! I'll prepare everything for the[ENTER]frog's leg soup.
9125	Received Frog's Legs
9126	Octavio
9127	Get Frog's Legs
9128	You have got a giant Frog's Leg. Return to[ENTER]Octavio.
9129	Kill Tree Frog Leaders
9131	Octavio needs Frog's Legs for his frog's leg[ENTER]soup. You can find them by hunting Tree Frog[ENTER]Leaders in the Hwang Temple.
9130	Storekeeper:
9132	I can't do this right now.
9133	What's up? When I was as young as you are, I got[ENTER]10 Frog's Legs a day.
9134	Try again
9135	You're already tired? Why don't you take a break[ENTER]and try again later?
9136	I could have used that frog's leg soup. But[ENTER]that's not going to happen. Shame. Bye!
9137	Then don't stand around here but go! The water is[ENTER]already boiling and everything is ready!
9138	Go to Octavio
9139	Now that's what I call a frog's leg! They used to[ENTER]be smaller but I'm sure this one is going to[ENTER]taste good too. Wait a moment... That already[ENTER]smells quite good. Another pinch of salt...[ENTER]Right! Here is your portion. Hahaha, now I have[ENTER]enough energy for a whole week's work.
9140	And don't tell anyone about it. Especially not[ENTER]the Storekeeper. He likes talking and if the[ENTER]qualities of this soup become known, I won't have[ENTER]a minute's peace because everyone will constantly[ENTER]be coming around to taste my soup.
9142	You have received 5,000,000 experience points.
9141	I haven't been very well lately. My body really[ENTER]isn't what it used to be. When I was young, I[ENTER]could work until night-time, every day of the[ENTER]week, whilst drinking alcohol. Now, it's even too[ENTER]much work to get up in the mornings. I need a[ENTER]large helping of frog's leg soup to get back my[ENTER]energy.
9143	You have received 50,000 Yang.
9144	Helping the Storekeeper
9145	Helping the Storekeeper
9146	The Storekeeper isn't feeling too clever.
9147	Go to him. Maybe you can help?
9148	You don't know what frog's leg soup is? When you[ENTER]drink a bowl of it, you are immediately wide[ENTER]awake and full of energy. The you can work a[ENTER]whole week straight without getting tired![ENTER]Octavio used to make this soup, but for some[ENTER]reason he stopped making it a little while ago.
9149	I'll go talk to Octavio.
9150	I'm busy.
9151	Do you want to give up this quest forever?
9152	OK, if you're busy, come back later if you find[ENTER]some time.
9154	He should be ashamed to call himself a father! If[ENTER]I find him then, God have mercy on his soul![ENTER]Believe me, I'm not exaggerating. Ask the others[ENTER]in the village, they agree with me.
9153	Soon
9155	General Store Saleswoman
9156	Go to the General Store Saleswoman
9157	Perhaps the General Store Saleswoman knows what[ENTER]Soon is up to. Go to her and ask whether she has[ENTER]heard something from Soon.
9158	What's up with Soon?
9159	Yesterday, he came here and asked for the Secret[ENTER]Temple Book. He had no Yang on him, so he just[ENTER]had a look at it. It must be very important to[ENTER]him if he's even neglecting his family for it.[ENTER]Why is he so interested in it?
9160	General Store Saleswoman:
9161	I feel sorry for Aranyo. She didn't marry Soon[ENTER]just so that she could work day and night. I'm[ENTER]sure she didn't expect that she would have to[ENTER]support her family by herself. You should talk to[ENTER]him. Who knows, perhaps he'll finally realise[ENTER]what he's doing wrong.
9162	Go to Soon
9163	Go to Soon 
9165	Soon again
9164	The joy of reading
9166	Go to Soon[ENTER]Go to Soon and ask him about the Temple Book.
9167	What is the Secret Temple Book?
9168	You know, I have read every book in the world.[ENTER]Recently, I've been hearing about a Secret Temple[ENTER]Book. Rumour has it that this book contains all[ENTER]the secrets to the Temple of Darkness. It also[ENTER]explains how you can become a saint.
9169	I really want to read that book. Could you get it[ENTER]for me? If you do it, I'll give you something in[ENTER]return, even if it means selling my house.
9170	I'll do it!
9171	I can't, sorry.
9172	Do you want to give up the quest forever?
9173	Come on, don't you want to help me? If not now,[ENTER]then come back later. I'll be waiting for you.
9174	You really don't want to help me? You need[ENTER]holiday, huh? The book is really important to me.[ENTER]What do I do now? Damn.
9176	Thanks, I'll be waiting for you.
9175	Do you like reading as much as I do?[ENTER]Words that join into sentences and are finally[ENTER]unified in a book. How wonderful! And the pure[ENTER]joy of writing a book so that other people can[ENTER]read it! It doesn't get any better than that!
9177	You have found the Secret Temple Book.
9178	You have found the Secret Temple Book. Now return[ENTER]to Soon.
9179	Return to Soon.
9180	Defeat the Dark Fanatics
9181	You have killed the Dark Fanatics.
9182	Take the Secret Temple Book to Soon.
9183	Soon has a profound interest in the Secret Temple[ENTER]Book. If you kill the Dark Fanatics, you might[ENTER]find the Secret Temple Book.
9184	The Secret Temple Book
9185	Oh, that's it! Many thanks![ENTER]Here is your reward.[ENTER]Now leave me alone, I have to read!
9187	You have received 850,000 experience points.
9186	Life is pulsing between the pages of this book![ENTER]Young knowledge and old wisdom live here![ENTER]Imagine how bleak my life would be without[ENTER]books... Only unfortunately... my wife doesn't[ENTER]understand it. Could you try convincing her that[ENTER]it's a good thing?
9188	You have received 20,000 Yang.
9189	Hey... You haven't got it yet? If you start a[ENTER]quest, you should see it through until the end.[ENTER]Now finish the quest!
9190	The Dark Fanatics are not to be underestimated.[ENTER]Just try again later.
9191	Well, then I have to ask somebody else for help.[ENTER]Farewell.
9192	Thanks, I'll be waiting for you. I can't wait to[ENTER]hold it in my hands and read it.
9193	Go to Soon
9194	Go to Soon
9195	Isn't Soon an odd character?
9196	Talk to him and find out what fascinates him[ENTER]about the world of books so much that he forgets[ENTER]everything else around him.
9197	Go to Aranyo
9198	Go to Aranyo 
9199	Go to Aranyo and ask about her husband.
9200	Why are you so angry?
9201	Angry? I'm about to explode with anger! Does my[ENTER]husband to out to work? No. Does he ever bring[ENTER]Yang home? No. Instead he's hiding away somewhere[ENTER]between the pages of a book! Have you ever heard[ENTER]anything like it? Can a book bring us clothing?[ENTER]Does it provide us with food?
9203	Ore for the Blacksmith
9202	Do you need ore?
9204	Blacksmith
9205	Back to the Blacksmith
9206	You have collected the Ore the Blacksmith needs[ENTER]to make new weapons. You should take it to him.
9207	Get ore for new weapons
9208	The Blacksmith needs ore for producing a new kind[ENTER]of weapon. He needs 100 pieces of Gold Ore, 100[ENTER]of Silver Ore and 100 pieces of Ebony Ore. Ore[ENTER]deposits can be found in assorted places on the[ENTER]map and collected in mines. But you can also[ENTER]trade with other players and buy it from them.
9209	I've collected Ore for you.
9210	That's not enough. I need all 100 gold ore, 100[ENTER]silver ore and 100 ebony ore.
9211	Keep on looking
9212	Give up
9214	You really want to give up forever?
9213	Hey, you! Yes, I mean you! You are not a beginner[ENTER]any more. And why? Because I have given you[ENTER]complicated tasks! It was only for your sake,[ENTER]hehehe. But now I'm asking you for a real favour.
9215	It is hard to get Ore, isn't it? Good luck only[ENTER]comes to those who work hard. How about taking a[ENTER]short break and trying it again later on?
9216	Shame. It was a brilliant idea.[ENTER]Oh well, what the heck. See you!
9217	If you make an effort you will soon have[ENTER]everything together. Good luck!
9218	Oh, you already have collected everything![ENTER]Hahaha! I can tell it's all going to work out.[ENTER]Wait a minute, it's not going to be long now.[ENTER]And here we go!
9219	Hmm, it's finished. Sometimes I'm surprised at[ENTER]just how talented I am. Here's your weapon.[ENTER]It's new, so take good care of it!
9220	You have received 200,000 experience points.
9221	You have received 20,000 Yang.
9222	You have received a Silver Sword+3.
9223	You have received an Aquatic Fan+3.
9225	The New Weapon
9224	I want to try to forge a new weapon but it's very[ENTER]difficult to get the materials. Could you do that[ENTER]for me? I will give you the first one I finish as[ENTER]a reward.
9226	The New Weapon
9227	I understand the Blacksmith wants to craft a new[ENTER]weapon.
9228	Presumably he'll need your help with that. Go to[ENTER]him!
9229	I need 100 Gold Ore, 100 Silver Ore and 100 Ebony[ENTER]Ore. That sounds more than it is. You can get a[ENTER]lot of raw materials all at once in the mines so[ENTER]that you can collect it easily.[ENTER]If it is still too difficult for you you can[ENTER]trade them with somebody. Just as you like. I[ENTER]wish you success!
9230	Refuse
9231	Do you want to give up the quest forever?
9232	No need to hurry. Come back if you change your[ENTER]mind.
9233	Shame. It was a brilliant idea.[ENTER]Oh well, what the heck. See you!
9234	Oh! You're going to do it?[ENTER]You're a good friend!
9236	Ore for the Blacksmith
9235	Go to the Blacksmith
9237	Back to the Blacksmith
9238	You have collected the ore the Blacksmith needs[ENTER]to make the new armours. You should take it to[ENTER]him.
9239	Get Ore for the new armours
9240	The Blacksmith needs ore to make a new kind of[ENTER]armour. Bring him 100 Copper Ore, 100 Ebony Ore[ENTER]and 100 Pieces of Pearl. Ore can be found all[ENTER]over the map and can be collected in mines. You[ENTER]can also trade with other players and buy ore[ENTER]from them.
9241	I have collected Ore for you.
9242	Hmmm, a lot of materials are missing. I said I[ENTER]need 100 Copper Ore, 100 Ebony Ore and 100 Pieces[ENTER]of Pearl!
9243	Continue
9244	Give up
9245	Do you want to give up the quest forever?
9247	Is it too hard? Of course, it isn't just about[ENTER]luck, but hard work, too. Why don't you just try[ENTER]again later?
9246	You still need more ore?
9248	Well, there go my plans for new armour. That idea[ENTER]could have changed the world! What a shame...
9249	Be strong! I know you can do it!
9250	Fantastic. You're really good at getting hold of[ENTER]materials. Now, pay attention. Here... and[ENTER]here... and I'll just quickly cool it down...[ENTER]Look, this is for you, as a reward for your[ENTER]efforts. See you soon!
9251	You have received 200,000 experience points.
9252	You have received 20,000 Yang.
9253	You have received a Lion Plate Armour+3.
9254	You have received a Red Ant Suit+3.
9255	You have received a Ghost Plate Armour+3.
9256	You have received an Amorous Clothing+3.
9258	The New Armour
9257	Hello, have you got a minute for me?[ENTER]I appreciate very much that you helped me to make[ENTER]a new weapon. Now I would like to ask for your[ENTER]help again. This time I would like to make a new[ENTER]armour. After I have made a new weapon it is[ENTER]obvious that I also need a good armour.
9259	The New Armour
9260	The Blacksmith needs your help again. This time[ENTER]he's making some new armour.
9261	Go to him to find out more details.
9262	Of course I need materials to make the new[ENTER]armour. Can you get them for me? In return you'll[ENTER]get the first completed armour. This time I need[ENTER]100 Copper Ore, 100 Ebony Ore and 100 Pieces of[ENTER]Pearl. You should know that already. I wish you[ENTER]success!
9263	Accept
9264	Do you want to give up the quest forever?
9265	Why are you hesitating? Come back when you ready[ENTER]to work in the mines.
9266	That little bit of ore isn't too much to ask.[ENTER]Well, please yourself. Get lost!
9267	You'll help me again? You are a good friend.[ENTER]And don't worry: the first armour is yours!
9269	Peddler's request
9268	Choose a merchant
9270	Go to Ah-Yu
9271	Go to the General Store Saleswoman
9272	Materials for the Merchant
9273	The Peddler needs some materials for a necklace.[ENTER]Get him 100 Molars from the Elite Orc Sorcerer, a[ENTER]Piece of Jewellery from the General Stores[ENTER]Saleswoman and Thread from Ariyoung.
9274	I need Thread.
9275	Producing Thread is no big deal. But then I can't[ENTER]do my other work. I've mended Ah-Yu's torn[ENTER]clothes today and just wanted to take them to[ENTER]her...
9276	What do you think: You take back Ah-Yu's clothes[ENTER]while I make Thread for you. Agreed?
9277	Do you want to give up forever?
9278	It is really isn't very far. Why are you still[ENTER]hesitating? Come back here when you are ready.
9280	Oh, I had hoped you'd have time. Then I have to[ENTER]go myself. Farewell!
9279	About the necklaces...
9281	Wonderful, thank you very much! Give my regards[ENTER]to Ah-Yu and make sure you don't crush her[ENTER]clothes on the way! I'll wait here for you.
9282	Ariyoung:
9283	By the time you come back from the neighbouring[ENTER]village I'll have finished your Thread. You[ENTER]haven't forgotten to take Ah-Yu her clothes, have[ENTER]you? She would resent me for that.
9284	Is Ah-Yu happy with her Clothes? In that case, it[ENTER]was a pleasure to work that hard for her. Here's[ENTER]your Thread. It's very strong and can be used for[ENTER]a number of things.
9285	I have already given you Thread. Have you lost it?
9286	Ariyoung sends you these clothes.
9287	Ah-Yu:
9288	Oh, how nice. That was really quick. You have to[ENTER]cultivate old friendships, don't you? We often[ENTER]help each other out...[ENTER]Thank you that you have brought the clothes.[ENTER]Please give Ariyoung my regards.
9289	I need a Piece of Jewellery.
9291	You are looking for jewellery?[ENTER]I can give you a Piece of Jewellery if you help[ENTER]me. At the moment I'm working on a special[ENTER]medicine against pain but I need one ingredient:[ENTER]a Tiger Liver. They are really difficult to get.[ENTER]I need 100 Tiger Livers.
9290	It is not easy for us Peddlers during war time.[ENTER]Merchandise is needed everywhere but the demand[ENTER]changes so quickly that I never know whether I[ENTER]have the right thing on offer. Not to mention the[ENTER]long ways through the wilderness where all the[ENTER]monsters are lying in wait for careless walkers.[ENTER]Don't you want to earn a few Yang? I could do[ENTER]with some help.
9292	I also need certain Medicinal Herbs but you'll[ENTER]also get these from the Tigers. They like to roll[ENTER]in them because they like the smell. I'll give[ENTER]you a Piece of Jewellery for the Herbs and the[ENTER]Tiger Livers.
9293	Hunt Tigers or White Tigers.
9294	What do you say? Can we do a deal?
9295	Is my task too difficult for you? I can't imagine[ENTER]that! Come and see me again when you have changed[ENTER]your mind.
9296	You come all this way for the Merchant and then[ENTER]give up? As you want...[ENTER]Have a nice day.
9297	Very good. That's going to help us both, isn't[ENTER]it? Thank you and good luck!
9298	Do I get my Piece of Jewellery now?
9299	Let me look... 100 Tiger Livers and the Medicinal[ENTER]Herbs, it's all there. Thank you![ENTER]There you are, you have really earned this Piece[ENTER]of Jewellery. See you!
9300	Back to the Peddler
9302	Return to the Peddler
9301	At the moment necklaces made of Orc Molars are[ENTER]really in demand. Orc Molars are big and hard and[ENTER]are good for making certain pieces of jewellery.[ENTER]Also soldiers think of Elite Orc Sorcerers'[ENTER]molars as lucky charms. Could you get these[ENTER]Molars for me? 100 Molars should be enough to[ENTER]start with.
9303	Return to the Peddler
9304	You have finally got all the materials for the[ENTER]necklace. Take them to the Peddler.
9305	I have all the materials.
9306	Peddler:
9307	Have you got all the materials? Let's see...[ENTER]Yes, everything is really there. Thanks to your[ENTER]help I can extend my supplies, that's good. Here[ENTER]is your share. Have fun.[ENTER]Come here, folks! Here is something for everybody!
9308	You have received 1,100,000 experience points.
9309	You get a Golden Bracelet, a Golden Necklace and[ENTER]Gold Earrings.
9310	Hmmm, I'm sorry but something is missing. I don't[ENTER]need incomplete deliveries. Will you keep trying?
9311	Do you want to give up the quest forever?
9313	Thank you for not giving up so easily.[ENTER]Luck is with those who try! I'll wait here for[ENTER]you.
9312	I also need a Piece of Jewellery and Thread. One[ENTER]you'll get from the General Store Saleswoman, the[ENTER]other from Ariyoung. It is not so easy to get so[ENTER]many things but selling necklaces is good[ENTER]business and you'll get a good reward for the[ENTER]materials. What do you think? Does that sound[ENTER]interesting?
9314	The task is too difficult? Well, at least you've[ENTER]tried. I'll let you know if I have an easier task[ENTER]for you one day. Farewell!
9315	You're going to try again? Thank you. I'll be[ENTER]waiting for you.
9316	Reset
9317	The quest will be reset. Do you want to continue?
9318	Peddler's Request
9319	Peddler's Request
9320	The Peddler has a job for you. Track him down to[ENTER]find out more!
9321	Open shop
9322	Do you want to give up the quest forever?
9323	You are busy? I can understand that. But please[ENTER]come back when you have time.
9324	Oh dear, how am I going to complete all my tasks?[ENTER]See you!
9325	Fantastic. I'll wait here for you.
9327	Treasure Map found
9326	Go to the bookworm.
9328	You hunted the animal gods outside the village[ENTER]and found all 4 parts of the Treasure Map.[ENTER]Take them to Soon.
9329	Hunting the animal gods
9330	Collect all 4 parts of the Treasure Map by[ENTER]hunting the animal gods Lykos, Scrofa, Bera and[ENTER]Tigris.
9331	(Parts of the map found: %s )
9332	The Treasure Map
9333	Collected all parts
9334	Return to Soon and tell him you found all the[ENTER]parts of the Treasure Map.
9335	I've got all the map parts.
9336	Oh! Fantastic! All four pieces together... I[ENTER]wouldn't have dreamed of this! Now I need to[ENTER]connect the pieces to get the whole map...[ENTER]right...
9337	Hmm... Strange. The map says that the treasure is[ENTER]hidden at the rock near the Old Man. I can't[ENTER]imagine that that's right. It would have been[ENTER]found by now. What a childish trick to play! Do[ENTER]you want to look anyway, or should I just burn[ENTER]the map?
9339	I'll have a look.
9338	About the Treasure Map...
9340	Burn it.
9341	Are you sure you don't need the map any more?
9342	What a pathetic fairytale![ENTER]I'm sorry that I sent you on a search for those[ENTER]map pieces. I'll burn them now so that no one[ENTER]else falls for them. Still, thank you very much.[ENTER]Goodbye.
9343	Why are you hesitating? You have already[ENTER]collected the pieces of the map. Then you can go[ENTER]and look. Here, take the map!
9344	As you like. I would be really surprised if you[ENTER]really found something but still, I wish you[ENTER]luck! Take the map!
9345	The map has been divided into four parts. We need[ENTER]all four parts to put it together again!
9346	Try again
9347	You give up? Oh well, so be it. Farewell.
9348	I knew you'd go. I believe in you!
9350	Rock next to the Old Man
9349	Hey, I found some strange information in some old[ENTER]texts. The texts say that there is a Treasure Map[ENTER]in the village. Do you know the godly animal[ENTER]guards; the God of Dogs, God of Bears, God of[ENTER]Tigers and the God of Pigs outside the city?
9351	Looking for the treasure
9352	Hmm, under the Old Man's rock...[ENTER]No idea. Maybe I should ask the Old Man. Why is[ENTER]he such a long way away? Damn.
9353	Old Man:
9354	What are you looking for? A treasure? Haha,[ENTER]you'll be looking for a long time! Show me the[ENTER]map... Hmmm. I think it's there over there. Good[ENTER]luck, hihi...
9355	This must be the place. Heave ho![ENTER]Damn, the floor seems to be quite hard. Hmm...[ENTER][ENTER]Hey I can see a box!
9356	The treasure really exists!
9357	Back to Soon
9358	You were digging in a place the Map of the Animal[ENTER]Gods showed and really found a Treasure Chest! Go[ENTER]to Soon and tell him about the unexpected[ENTER]outcome.
9359	I have found the treasure!
9361	Oh! This is a surprise! Let's see... Amazing.[ENTER]This is exactly how the treasure chest was[ENTER]described in the old texts. Now I only have to[ENTER]find out how to open it. But that is not your[ENTER]problem. Thanks! Here, take this as a token of my[ENTER]gratitude!
9360	A ancient fairy tale says that these four godlike[ENTER]monsters divided the map into four parts and[ENTER]protected these territories. I'm not sure if[ENTER]that's right. Could you check that for me? Oh[ENTER]please, this uncertainty is killing me... I'm[ENTER]begging you, please help me!
9362	You receive 1,400,000 experience points.
9363	You have received 25,000 Yang.
9364	You have received a Ghost Mask Sallet+1.
9365	You have received a Castle Helmet+1.
9366	You have received a Steel Hood+1.
9367	You have received a Sunlight Hat+1.
9368	Well, where is he? Do you want to make fun of[ENTER]me?! You haven't really found him, have you?
9369	The Bookworm's Treasure Map
9370	The Bookworm's Treasure Map
9372	Soon said he had some news for you.
9371	You're not interested in old Treasure Maps? You[ENTER]are strange... I'm going to carry on looking for[ENTER]clues in these texts. Come back if you change[ENTER]your mind.
9373	Go to him to learn more.
9374	You don't like those kinds of adventures, do you?[ENTER]How am I supposed to get the pieces of the map?[ENTER]Ah well... Farewell
9375	You are a true friend. I believe that you'll find[ENTER]them.
9376	The bookworm's Treasure Map
9377	Go to the bookworm
9379	The Captain still has problems to get the Black[ENTER]Wind Gang under control. Kill the Generals of the[ENTER]Black Wind Gang Jak-To, To-Su and Gu-Ryung.[ENTER]Perhaps they are quiet then.
9378	What is the Black Wind Gang doing?
9380	The generals are dead!
9381	Try again
9382	Do you want to give up the quest forever?
9383	Fighting isn't easy, and winning is even harder.[ENTER]Especially if you're fighting the generals. Try[ENTER]again!
9384	Like I said, the Black Wind Gang is a very strong[ENTER]group. Goodbye.
9385	You are really brave! I think you can defeat the[ENTER]Black Wind Gang!
9386	Report to the Captain
9387	Return to the Captain and inform him that you[ENTER]have killed the generals.
9388	I've killed the Generals!
9389	Hmm...You defeated the generals. Great. The Black[ENTER]Wind Gang was started to give us all a headache,[ENTER]but thanks to your help we'll be able to defeat[ENTER]them now. Without the generals around, it'll be a[ENTER]piece of cake. Here's a reward for you. I hope to[ENTER]see you again soon!
9391	You receive 1,000,000 experience points.
9390	Captain:
9392	You have received a language ring.
9393	Kill the Black Wind Generals
9394	Kill the Black Wind Generals
9395	The Black Wind Gang just won't let up.
9396	Find the Captain. He wants to talk to you about[ENTER]his plan.
9397	Although you defeated the Black Wind Gang, they[ENTER]just don't want to give up. Instead of keeping a[ENTER]low profile, they are behaving like a horde of[ENTER]wild animals. If we want to defeat them, we have[ENTER]to kill the generals of the Black Wind Gang.
9398	Once the generals are defeated, the other members[ENTER]will go down too. It's going to be hard work, but[ENTER]we need to defeat the Black Wind generals Jak-To,[ENTER]To-Su and Gu-Ryung . If we defeat them, we won't[ENTER]have to worry about the Black Wind Gang any more.[ENTER]OK, so good luck, I'll be praying for your[ENTER]victory.
9399	Do you want to give up the quest forever?
9400	Well, all right. Come back when you're ready.[ENTER]There aren't many people that are as competent as[ENTER]you.
9401	You can't do it...?[ENTER]How are we going to defeat the Black Wind Gang[ENTER]now?
9402	I knew I could rely on you! Once the generals are[ENTER]killed, the other members of the Black Wind Gang[ENTER]won't be a problem any more. Good luck!
9403	Kill the Black Wind generals
9405	Off to see the Stable Boy
9404	Yonah
9406	You have collected 10 bundles of Hay. Take them[ENTER]to the Stable Boy so that he can feed the horses.
9407	Hay for the stables
9408	There is a food shortage at the stables. Get 10[ENTER]Bundles of Hay and take them to the Stable Boy[ENTER]before the horses starve! You can get Hay on the[ENTER]hunt.
9409	You need Hay?
9410	You came here because Yonah sent you? I have[ENTER]heard so much about you. Oh, all of our horses[ENTER]are going to starve. We need to save them. Help[ENTER]me and get Hay for the horses!
9411	A promise is a promise. Also I might like to ride[ENTER]a horse later. I absolutely have to find some[ENTER]Hay!
9412	I'm sorry. I'm looking but it is simply[ENTER]impossible to find any Hay.
9413	I know it's not very nice of me to ask you to do[ENTER]my work, but I still hoped you'd do it. Could you[ENTER]try again? I know a very important person in[ENTER]another kingdom. If you help me, I'll ask him if[ENTER]he can do something for you.
9414	Try again
9416	Of course I'll help you. Let's see what I can do.
9415	The stables are in trouble
9417	I don't have enough energy for that. I would like[ENTER]to help you, but I can't. I'm not strong enough.
9418	I have Hay for the horses.
9419	Have you got the Hay? Oh, thanks. We didn't have[ENTER]enough food for the horses, so I told Yonah. He[ENTER]is a good friend of mine. I had an idea he would[ENTER]ask around to see whether anybody could help. But[ENTER]I would not have thought it would be sorted out[ENTER]so quickly. Just look how enthusiastically the[ENTER]horses are eating!
9420	You receive 1,800,000 experience points.
9421	Return to Yonah
9422	Return to Yonah
9423	You took 10 bundles of Hay for the hungry horses[ENTER]to the Stable Boy. Return to Yonah and tell him[ENTER]about your success.
9424	The horses are taken care of!
9425	Hello, you're back![ENTER]It was probably a tough job to collect that much[ENTER]Hay. Thanks for not giving up! Here's a small[ENTER]present for you.
9427	You have received a Mission Book.
9426	Hey, I have a question for you! I know someone[ENTER]else is responsible for the stables, but we have[ENTER]had lots of trouble recently and could do with[ENTER]your help. The horses have had a lot to do during[ENTER]the war, but even a strong, adult horse has its[ENTER]limits.
9428	The Stables Are in Trouble
9429	The Stables Are in Trouble
9430	Yonah wants to ask you for a favour.
9431	Go to him to learn more.
9432	There are so many horses, but not enough food. A[ENTER]lot of them are dying. Could you please get some[ENTER]food for the horses so they can regain some of[ENTER]their energy? I don't have anyone else who I[ENTER]could ask. Collect 10 bales of Hay and take them[ENTER]to the Stable Boy. He already knows the problem.[ENTER]Just tell him that I sent you.
9433	I'm leaving immediately!
9434	No, that is a menial job.
9435	Nowadays, more and more people want to have a[ENTER]horse. But nobody has thought about the fact[ENTER]we're running out of food for the horses. And now[ENTER]they're starving in the stable. If you change[ENTER]your mind, come back.
9436	Oh, those poor horses! They're starving and I[ENTER]can't do anything about it. What should I do...
9437	I know you are busy and I really appreciate your[ENTER]help. Horses are really important nowadays.[ENTER]And we really need the Hay.
9439	Yonah is doing his best to produce new porcelain[ENTER]but is not making any progress with his[ENTER]experiments. Go to Uriel the scholar and ask him[ENTER]whether he knows anything about Celadon[ENTER]Porcelain.
9438	The secret of Celadon Porcelain
9440	Do you know Celadon Porcelain?
9441	Uriel:
9442	Celadon Porcelain? Well, I know a lot about[ENTER]history and science, but I'm not really[ENTER]interested in art. That's why I'm afraid I can't[ENTER]tell you anything about Celadon Porcelain.[ENTER]But maybe Soon knows? He's not very popular, but[ENTER]he reads a lot of books. He might know something[ENTER]about it.
9443	Go to Soon
9444	Go to Soon
9445	Unfortunately Uriel does not know anything about[ENTER]Celadon Porcelain. But Soon the bookworm reads a[ENTER]lot in his books. Go see him and ask him whether[ENTER]he knows anything about how it is made.
9446	Soon:
9447	What do you want? Don't disturb me when I'm[ENTER]reading! Huh? Celadon Porcelain? Of course I know[ENTER]about it. I have read almost a dozen books on[ENTER]that particular topic alone. Why? Well they don't[ENTER]call me the 'bookworm' for nothing, you know! I[ENTER]can understand everything that has been written[ENTER]in books!
9448	I could write down how to make Celadon Porcelain[ENTER]off the top of my head, but why should I do that?[ENTER]Hmm. Well, wait, I have an idea: I asked the[ENTER]Peddler in the next village for a book that I'm[ENTER]still missing but I don't have time to go there.[ENTER]Please get it for me, then I will help you with[ENTER]the porcelain. Off you go!
9450	Off to the Peddler's
9449	Yonah:
9451	Go to the Peddler
9452	Soon the bookworm knows all about Celadon[ENTER]Porcelain. He does not want to share his[ENTER]knowledge without getting something in return.[ENTER]Head to the Peddler to pick up the Book that Soon[ENTER]has ordered.
9453	Soon sends me...
9454	Hey, You came back to help me again? Ahh. You[ENTER]want the book for Soon. I would have been going[ENTER]into the city soon anyway, but he is very[ENTER]impatient and asks others to get it for him. Hmm.[ENTER]Here it is. I don't understand what Soon likes[ENTER]about these stack of papers. It's much more[ENTER]important to quickly earn Yang!
9455	Return to Soon.
9456	Returning to Soon
9457	You've got Soon's book from the Peddler. Go back[ENTER]to Soon to give him the book so he'll tell you[ENTER]how to make Celadon Porcelain.
9458	I have got the book.
9459	Yay! I have finally got the new book! Thank you[ENTER]very much. There aren't very many books I haven't[ENTER]read...[ENTER]I've written down what what is important about[ENTER]making Celadon Porcelain. Stick to my notes and[ENTER]you will produce fantastic porcelain.[ENTER]And now it's time for me to read the new book.[ENTER]Farewell.
9461	Return to Yonah
9460	Hmm... This isn't any good. And neither is this[ENTER]one... Oh, hello! Look here: I produce porcelain[ENTER]non-stop, but most of it breaks immediately. I[ENTER]think I need a new type of ground-breaking[ENTER]porcelain...
9462	Take the notes to Yonah
9463	Soon has kept his promise and written down how to[ENTER]fire Celadon Porcelain. Take it to Yonah.
9464	Ooh!!![ENTER]Everything about the production of Celadon[ENTER]Porcelain is written here. With the help of these[ENTER]notes I'm finally going to go down in history as[ENTER]a master of crafts. Thanks for your help. I'll be[ENTER]able to show you my best ceramic work soon! You[ENTER]can count on me! I'm going to produce such[ENTER]fantastic Celadon Porcelain that it will survive[ENTER]for centuries.
9465	You have received 2,500,000 experience points.
9466	You have received 35,000 Yang.
9467	You have received Jade Shoes+3.
9468	The Secret of Celadon Porcelain
9469	The Secret of Celadon Porcelain
9470	Yonah looks worried.
9472	Go to him and find out how you can help.
9471	I'm going to try a new method. It isn't easy to[ENTER]produce Celadon Porcelain, that's why only very[ENTER]few people know how to do it. I need to know it,[ENTER]though, for the sake of my art! Well.... Hmm,[ENTER]Uriel the scholar might know how to do it! Please[ENTER]go see Uriel and ask him how Celadon Porcelain is[ENTER]made!
9473	Do you want to quit this quest?
9474	Hm, I guess you're too busy? Remember to come[ENTER]back if you have some spare time.
9475	I understand. Farewell...
9476	Thank you. Uriel will know what to do. See you[ENTER]soon!
9477	Let's go to Uriel
9479	The hunter's Lavishly Decorated Bow, which is a[ENTER]family heirloom, has been stolen from him. Go to[ENTER]Sangsun Dong and get back the Decorated Bow from[ENTER]the thieving monkeys.
9478	The hunter's treasure
9480	Found the Lavishly Decorated Bow
9481	Go to the hunter Yang-Shin
9482	You have found the Lavishly Decorated Bow of the[ENTER]Hunter. Bring it back to Yang-Shin.
9483	Here's the bow!
9484	Wow, that's it! My bow, yay! My honour has been[ENTER]restored. Phew. I've been suffering for so long[ENTER]since I lost it... I'm really grateful for your[ENTER]help. It's an honour for me to give you this[ENTER]here. It may not look like much, but it's from[ENTER]the heart so take it. Thanks to you, I can carry[ENTER]on my life in peace!
9485	You receive 1,500,000 experience points.
9486	You have received 35,000 Yang.
9487	You have received a Bravery Cape.
9488	You have found my Bow? But where is it? Have you[ENTER]lost it again?
9489	I'll keep looking.
9491	So be it.[ENTER]Look after yourself.
9490	Hey, could you listen to me for a second? As you[ENTER]can see, I'm a hunter; my family has been hunting[ENTER]for generations. We're all hunters, a family with[ENTER]so much honour. But I made a big mistake that is[ENTER]going to dishonour me in front of my whole[ENTER]family...
9492	Could you try again? Thank you.[ENTER]With your skills, you should be able to do it.
9493	The Hunter's Treasure
9494	The Hunter's Treasure
9495	Yang-Shin needs your help.
9496	Go to him to find out more.
9497	It is about a Lavishly Decorated Bow which was[ENTER]stolen by monkeys a while ago. I was hunting in[ENTER]the Monkey Dungeon at the time and was only[ENTER]inattentive for a second - they took advantage of[ENTER]the situation and stole it from me.
9498	I have never been into the depths of the Sangsun[ENTER]Dong, so I don't really know my way around there[ENTER]and need your help. A few locals told me that you[ENTER]are very talented. That's why I have asked you[ENTER]this favour. I can't face my ancestors without my[ENTER]Decorated Bow.
9499	Yang-Shin:
9500	Oh, I need it back as soon as possible...[ENTER]Please come back when you have some time.[ENTER]Farewell.
9501	Well then...[ENTER]Watch out on your travels.
9502	You can find it easily, because it's a richly[ENTER]ornamented bow. I will give you a great reward[ENTER]for it!
9503	Look for the Lavishly Decorated Bow
9505	Traitor Balso's condition
9504	Delivery for the Traitor Balso
9506	Traitor Balso's health has worsened. Go to[ENTER]Baek-Go and ask him how we can help Balso.
9507	Go to Baek-Go
9508	Go to Baek-Go
9509	Off to Baek-Go's
9510	I have a patient...
9511	Baek-Go: 
9512	Oh, it's you, how are you? You are treating a[ENTER]sick patient? Tell me what's wrong with him...[ENTER]Hmm... And what medicine has he been taking?[ENTER]What?! No wonder he is getting worse! This[ENTER]medicine is totally unsuitable!
9513	He is lucky to be still alive! It is very[ENTER]dangerous to give a sick person the wrong[ENTER]treatment! But I know what will help him. There[ENTER]is a certain herb that rids the body of poison[ENTER]and will restore his health.[ENTER]However, searching for it is very dangerous.
9514	As far as I know the herb only grows in Sangsun[ENTER]Dong. But it is always harvested for the Monkey[ENTER]Lord who likes to eat it. You will have to kill[ENTER]him to get it.[ENTER]I can make the right medicine if you bring me the[ENTER]herb.
9516	Okay, I'll get it.
9515	About your medicine...
9517	I can't do that.
9518	Do you want to quit this quest?
9519	Yes
9520	Well, maybe later, when you have some spare time.[ENTER]A lot of people are sick, but very few are[ENTER]looking for the cure.
9521	Hmm, that's just the way it is. It's a shame that[ENTER]no one is brave enough. How is all this going to[ENTER]end...
9522	Oh, thanks. It's going to be hard work. But you[ENTER]will be helping a number of people!
9523	Herb of the Ape Lord
9524	Go back to Baek-Go
9525	Found herb of the Hard Monkey
9527	You have taken the Herb of the Hard Monkey from[ENTER]the Ape Lord. Take it to Baek-Go, so he can make[ENTER]the medicine for Balso.
9526	Thank you for bringing me that medicine last[ENTER]time. But there is a problem... The medicine has[ENTER]lost its effect. I think it's gone bad.[ENTER]*Cough* - I desperately need treatment.
9528	Get the herb from Sangsun Dong
9529	Baek-Go can make a medicine for Balso the[ENTER]traitor's disease. He needs the Herb of the Hard[ENTER]Monkey for that. You can get it from the Ape Lord[ENTER]in the Hard Monkey Dungeon.
9530	Herb of the Hard Monkey...
9531	It seems as if the disease is spreading into an[ENTER]epidemic, but we don't know the cause. However,[ENTER]the academic organisation told us that a cure is[ENTER]possible with Monkey Herbs. What's wrong? Have[ENTER]you already found the herb?
9532	Not yet. But soon!
9533	I can't get hold of the herb.
9534	Do you really want to give up? Hmm, I suppose you[ENTER]can't really do any more, than that. What shall I[ENTER]do? This herb could be a real blessing...
9535	I can't do it.
9536	I want to help!
9538	The monkeys are too strong for me. I can't get to[ENTER]the herb. I'm sorry.
9537	I know that there is a doctor living in the next[ENTER]village. Could you go to him and explain my[ENTER]situation to him so that he can tell you what can[ENTER]be done? As you can see, I can't leave the[ENTER]village in this condition. I'm very grateful that[ENTER]you helped me last time and rest assured that I[ENTER]will reward you this time, too.
9539	You refuse to help people who are suffering from[ENTER]a mysterious and terrible disease. Get out of my[ENTER]sight!
9540	You are right. Somebody has to get this herb[ENTER]otherwise all these sick people will suffer[ENTER]terribly. I'll take care of this.
9541	Well then. Hurry up!
9542	You really managed to get the Herb of the Hard[ENTER]Monkey! I hope it can really heal this mysterious[ENTER]disease. Wait a second, I'll quickly make the[ENTER]medicine now...
9543	Baek-Go:
9544	Here's the medicine. Hurry to the patient and[ENTER]give it to him. Then he should be better soon.[ENTER]Also, please tell him that it is always better to[ENTER]ask a doctor which medicine is the right one.
9545	Take the medicine to Balso
9546	You give the medicine to Balso.
9547	Traitor Balso's medicine
9549	Baek-Go has made medicine from the Herb of the[ENTER]Hard Monkey which can cure many rare diseases.[ENTER]Take it to the Traitor Balso in the neighbouring[ENTER]village.
9548	Do you want to quit the quest?
9550	Here's the medicine.
9551	Are you bringing me the new medicine? There has[ENTER]been some progress in medical research? Sorry for[ENTER]troubling you. I should have asked a doctor for[ENTER]advice right from the start. However, I have to[ENTER]accept that I have to take this medicine now.
9552	Thank you for helping me to get out of my[ENTER]miserable condition. I don't have many friends.[ENTER]Here, I know it's not much, but it comes from the[ENTER]heart. Please accept it. If I ever make it, I[ENTER]will never forget you.
9553	You have received 4,000,000 experience points.
9554	You have received 65,000 Yang.
9555	Delivery for the Traitor Balso
9556	Delivery for the Traitor Balso
9557	Balso's health has deteriorated. Go to him, he[ENTER]needs your assistance!
9558	If you know how to help me, we'll meet here again.
9559	Traitor Balso:
9560	Do I have to continue living like this?[ENTER]See you next time.
9561	Thank you. Be careful.
9563	I knew I could count on you! It is a difficult[ENTER]job, but I am sure you'll be able to do it. Good[ENTER]luck!
9562	Supporting war device
9564	Return to the Captain
9565	You have collected all 5,000 Arrowheads. Take[ENTER]them to the Captain.
9566	The army has problems to get more arrows. Kill[ENTER]Plagued Archers at Mount Sohan and get their[ENTER]Arrowheads for the Captain. 5,000 are enough.
9567	About the Arrowheads...
9568	These Plagued Archers have a certain disease[ENTER]which has spread across the continent. Not even[ENTER]our doctors can explain it. Arrowheads are still[ENTER]normal at the moment, but they are becoming more[ENTER]and more toxic.
9569	I'll carry on.
9570	Do you really want to give up the quest?
9571	You're afraid of the disease. Calm down and come[ENTER]back later.
9572	Are you sure you want to give up? Hmm, maybe this[ENTER]task really is too hard for you. I'll ask someone[ENTER]else. See you!
9574	I see.[ENTER]You never give up, do you?[ENTER]Let's go.
9573	Attention warriors! As you can see, the number of[ENTER]attacks made by our enemies is increasing every[ENTER]day. We have also received alarming information[ENTER]from Yu-Hwan. To cut a long story short: We don't[ENTER]have enough arrows!
9575	Here are 5,000 Arrowheads!
9576	Fantastic work! Now we can prepare for the[ENTER]attack. Now I'm going to give you the order to[ENTER]make some arrows immediately. That was a really[ENTER]good team effort. I hope we can count on you[ENTER]later.
9577	Here is your reward. Next time I have an[ENTER]important job, you'll be the first one I call.[ENTER]All the best and see you soon!
9578	You have received 4,500,000 experience points.
9579	You have received 50,000 Yang.
9580	You have received 3 x Critical Strike.[ENTER]You have received 3 x Piercing Strike.
9581	Supporting War Device
9582	Supporting War Device
9583	Reports have come to us of suspicious troop[ENTER]movements behind enemy lines.
9585	The Captain wants to know more. Go to him.
9584	Archers are an important strategic factor in[ENTER]warfare. As soon as the enemies are within reach[ENTER]our archers should fire at them. That way we can[ENTER]either chase them away immediately or at least[ENTER]reduce their number. But if there are too many[ENTER]attacks in a short time we are soon out of[ENTER]arrows.
9586	That's why we need you! Go to Mount Sohan and[ENTER]kill Plagued Archers to get their Arrowheads.[ENTER]Those Arrowheads are poisonous but their effect[ENTER]will help us to defeat the enemy.[ENTER]We need 5,000 Arrowheads. What do you say?
9587	I accept.
9588	That's hard for me.
9589	Do you want to give up this quest?
9590	Is it too far to Mount Sohan for you? Think about[ENTER]it. This mission is of great importance.
9591	Hm, you're afraid of Plagued Archers? I suppose I[ENTER]overestimated you. I see there's no more hope for[ENTER]us.
9592	What are you reading?
9594	You have collected all 100 Spider Eyes for[ENTER]Octavio's new recipe. You should quickly take[ENTER]them to him.
9593	Spider Eyes special
9595	Get Spider Eyes
9596	Octavio wants to try out his new recipe called[ENTER]'Spider Eyes special'. To make it he needs 100[ENTER]Spider Eyes from the spiders in the Yongbi[ENTER]desert.
9597	Return to Octavio
9598	I have the Spider Eyes.
9599	Octavio:
9600	Show me. Exactly one hundred eyes, very good.[ENTER]Well, let's see...[ENTER]Mmhhh, done! Do you also want to try? Don't look[ENTER]so horrified. It's not going to kill you.
9601	Hmm, hmm... What an experience! Very nutritious,[ENTER]not too sweet.... incredible taste! I knew it was[ENTER]worth the effort. I could have never done it[ENTER]without you. Thank you very much for your help!
9602	You have received 2,100,000 experience points.
9603	What are you talking about? That are not one[ENTER]hundred eyes, I can tell without counting them![ENTER]Please get some more.
9605	I really want to cook this.[ENTER]Never mind, thanks. Take care and look after[ENTER]yourself.
9604	Hey, how are you? I'm just reading a cookery book[ENTER]that Soon very kindly gave me. I found a very[ENTER]interesting recipe called 'Spider Eyes special'[ENTER]in it. I've never seen anything like it before![ENTER]Have you? It seems to be special dish from[ENTER]another country.
9606	Thank you for not leaving me in the lurch.[ENTER]You're very kind!
9607	Spider Eyes Special
9608	Spider Eyes Special
9609	Octavio is dabbling around with a new recipe.
9610	But he could use your help!
9611	I would really like to try this dish but how am I[ENTER]supposed to get hold of the Spider Eyes? I really[ENTER]need your help again! Please get Spider Eyes from[ENTER]the Spiders in the Yongbi Desert.
9612	Could you do that for me? I would really be very[ENTER]grateful. To try I this recipe I need one hundred[ENTER]eyes for a reasonably sized portion. I'm really[ENTER]excited...
9613	Do you want to quit this quest?
9614	I really want to make this recipe, so if you feel[ENTER]like doing me a favour, please come visit me.
9615	Hm, where am I going to get these eyes from?[ENTER]Okay, see you soon.
9616	Thank you. I knew you'd do me this favour. I'll[ENTER]treat you to a really nice meal for doing this.
9617	Return to Octavio
9619	Sorry to hear that. I hear so many voices of dead[ENTER]people, who just can't rest in peace. We really[ENTER]have to help them. I'll ask someone else.[ENTER]Farewell.
9618	Let the dead rest
9620	How brave you are. I'm sure the brave young[ENTER]warriors will soon get to Nirvana with your help.
9621	Terrible wars kill young men more and more often.[ENTER]They fight at the front line, fighting for[ENTER]themselves, their families and their countries.[ENTER]But after death, some of them didn't go to[ENTER]Nirvana and stayed in this world instead.
9622	I heard that the Proud Dark Colonel in the Hwang[ENTER]Temple has a Temple Scarf and a Temple Doctrine.[ENTER]Please help me and my comrades calm down those[ENTER]who died for their country.
9623	Return to the Dragon Force Teacher
9624	You have found a Temple Scarf and a Temple[ENTER]Doctrine. Take them to the Dragon Force Teacher,[ENTER]so that the Shamans can begin their ritual to[ENTER]calm down the dead.
9625	Get the Temple Scarf and the Temple Doctrine
9626	The Shamans need a Temple Scarf and a Temple[ENTER]Doctrine for a ceremony to calm down the spirits[ENTER]of the soldiers who died during the war.[ENTER]Kill the Proud Dark Colonel in the Hwang Temple[ENTER]to get the ritual objects.
9627	I have got the Scarf and the Doctrine.
9628	That was great. Now we can calm down the dead[ENTER]soldiers. They did their best and now they can[ENTER]finally rest in peace. Let me give you a reward[ENTER]for your good deed.
9630	You have received 1,700,000 experience points.
9629	Dragon Force Teacher:
9631	You have received 30,000 Yang.
9632	You have received 3 Diamonds.
9633	That was great. Now we can calm down the dead[ENTER]soldiers. They did their best. Now, they can rest[ENTER]in peace. Let me give you a reward for this noble[ENTER]deed.
9634	Let the Dead Rest
9635	Let the Dead Rest
9636	There are spirits trapped in this mortal world...
9637	Find the Dragon Force Teacher to find out more.
9638	These terrible wars keep killing more and more[ENTER]young men. They are soliders that are fighting[ENTER]for their families and for their country at the[ENTER]front-line. But after their death, some of them[ENTER]just cannot pass into Nirvana. And so they remain[ENTER]in this world.
9639	It is said they became resistant to death during[ENTER]the war. They think that they still have to[ENTER]defend their country.[ENTER]Our Shamans want to hold a ceremony to calm down[ENTER]the spirits. In order to do that, we need a[ENTER]special Temple Scarf and a Temple Doctrine, which[ENTER]are hard to find nowadays. Could you get both of[ENTER]those things for us?
9640	I heard that the Proud Dark Colonel in the Hwang[ENTER]Temple apparently has a Temple Scarf and a Temple[ENTER]Doctrine. Please help me and my comrades to calm[ENTER]down those who died for their country.
9641	I'll help you.
9642	I'm sorry, I'm too scared.
9643	Do you want to quit this quest?
9644	Help us to calm down their souls, so that they[ENTER]can rest in peace. I'll wait for your help here.
9646	The Spider with the Bell
9645	The spider
9647	Taurean said he hung a bell on a spider.[ENTER]Now Yu-Rang wants to know whether her friend was[ENTER]really that brave as he said.[ENTER]Look for the spider in the desert.
9648	Have you found the spider with the bell yet?[ENTER]No? You'll probably never find it. Taurean is a[ENTER]coward and just wanted to show off!
9649	Can't find a bell
9650	A lot of spiders, no bell
9651	You have killed some spiders but have not found a[ENTER]bell. You can't look forever. It would probably[ENTER]be best to go to Taurean and ask him for the[ENTER]truth.
9652	Go to Taurean
9653	Ask Taurean about the bell
9654	It is unlikely that Taurean was brave enough to[ENTER]put a bell on a spider. It's best to ask him[ENTER]directly for the truth.
9655	Tell me, about your bet with Yu-Rang...
9657	You know about the bet with Yu-Rang? She doesn't[ENTER]believe me and thinks that I didn't do it. She[ENTER]thinks that I would drop dead if I only looked at[ENTER]a giant spider.
9656	A spider with a bell...?
9658	To be honest... She is right. I wasn't brave[ENTER]enough to tell her because I am too proud.
9659	But you look very strong! Can't you put the bell[ENTER]on a baby spider for me and then say it was me?[ENTER]Please, please. Otherwise they will make fun of[ENTER]me for the rest of my life.
9660	Do you want to give up the quest?
9661	You don't want to do it? But you are not going to[ENTER]tell Yu-Rang the truth?[ENTER]Please, help me. Come back when you have time for[ENTER]me!
9662	Now Yu-Rang will never talk to me again![ENTER]Or just laugh at me...
9663	Ah, I was right. I knew you were as nice as you[ENTER]look. Thank you for your help. Good luck!
9664	Go back to Yu-Rang
9665	Go back to Yu-Rang and tell her about Taurean's[ENTER]lie.
9666	Yu-Rang is very disappointed in you.
9668	You have told her?![ENTER]I can understand that she doesn't want to be my[ENTER]friend any more. But it makes me very sad. I hope[ENTER]that I can change her mind some time. Perhaps I[ENTER]can think of something nice for her...
9667	Hey, could you do me a favour? My friend Taurean[ENTER]is very angry because I called him a coward.[ENTER]He says that he's actually very brave, and he[ENTER]made a bet with me that he would manage to hang a[ENTER]bell on a Baby Spider. He also told me that he[ENTER]had already done it, but I just can't believe[ENTER]him.
9669	Taurean lied.
9670	His story isn't true?[ENTER]Hmm, I'm not really angry that he lied. Nobody[ENTER]likes to lose face.[ENTER]But he should have at least tried to make it[ENTER]true! I don't want to be friends with such a[ENTER]coward any more.
9671	Yu-Rang will give you a reward for your honesty.
9672	You have received 30,000 Yang.

9674	Bell for the spider
9675	Go to the desert to the Baby Spiders and try to[ENTER]hang Taurean's bell on one of them.
9676	About the bell...
9677	You haven't hung the bell onto the spider yet?[ENTER]Then please do it soon. And make sure Yu-Rang[ENTER]doesn't catch you!
9679	Done!
9678	I know I should trust my friend, but I want to[ENTER]know if he really did it. It's too dangerous for[ENTER]me in the desert. You look very strong. You could[ENTER]easily do it. Could you go and have a look for[ENTER]me?
9680	It was very difficult, but you finally managed to[ENTER]hang the bell onto a Baby Spider. Now go to[ENTER]Yu-Rang and tell her that Taurean did it.
9681	The bell has been hung on the spider.
9682	You have done it? That's fantastic![ENTER]Then quickly tell Yu-Rang so that she finally[ENTER]believes me!
9683	Taurean has told the truth.
9684	Come again? You have found a spider with a bell?[ENTER]Then Taurean really did it. I would have not[ENTER]thought it possible. Perhaps he will be a real[ENTER]man one day after all. Thank you for checking[ENTER]that for me. Here's a reward for your help.
9685	Go back to Taurean
9686	Back to Taurean
9687	You have told Yu-Rang that her friend has really[ENTER]hung a bell on a Baby Spider.[ENTER]Now go back to Tauran and tell him about the[ENTER]successful deception.
9688	Yu-Rang believes you.
9690	Thanks a lot. Now Yu-Rang won't despise me. We[ENTER]have to keep this a secret forever. Promise? See[ENTER]you soon!
9689	Accept
9691	Taurean gives you a reward for helping him to[ENTER]lie: you have received 30,000 Yang.
9692	You have received 700,000 experience points.
9693	The Spider with the Bell
9694	The Spider with the Bell
9695	Yu-Rang was looking for you.
9696	Go to her and find out what she's after.
9697	Do you want to quit the quest?
9698	Why not? Are you afraid?[ENTER]Visit me when you have changed your mind.
9699	Aaah, are you afraid?[ENTER]But you are much taller and stronger than me![ENTER]Haha, you are a coward! Then I have to ask[ENTER]someone else.
9700	The spiders live in the desert. You are strong. I[ENTER]am sure you can do it. Good luck!
9702	Get the secret information
9701	The thing about the Temple of Darkness
9703	You have the Temple Doctrine, the Temple Scarf[ENTER]and the Translation of the Cursebook. Take them[ENTER]to Soon.
9704	If you help Soon, the bookworm, he can continue[ENTER]his research about the Temple of Darkness.[ENTER]However, he can only do this if he gets hold of[ENTER]the following things: The Temple Doctrine, the[ENTER]Temple Scarf and the Translation of the[ENTER]Cursebook. Get hold of these things and take them[ENTER]to Soon. You'll find them in the Hwang Temple in[ENTER]the Valley of Seungryong.
9705	The things from the Temple of Darkness
9706	Ah, you've got them! Thank you very much.[ENTER]About the secret people in the temple, well, it's[ENTER]pretty simple: they're dangerous people.[ENTER]But you've learned that the hard way.[ENTER]They also seem to be serving the evil gods. I[ENTER]don't know any details, but I presume that they[ENTER]are planning something really bad.
9707	Now that I have some of their holy things I will[ENTER]hopefully find out more. Best to start with the[ENTER]Temple Doctrine.[ENTER]Let's see... Hmm... Aha...[ENTER]Why are you still hanging around here? Haven't[ENTER]you got anything to do?
9708	You have received 7,000,000 experience points.
9709	You have received 700,000 Yang.
9710	You have received the Book of the Leader.
9711	What? You don't have them? Don't slack off if you[ENTER]accept a request! Hurry up!
9713	Try again
9712	There is something going on inside the Temple of[ENTER]Darkness. I think there are dangerous creatures[ENTER]in there, studying ancient magic.[ENTER]The secrets of the Temple of Darkness are hard to[ENTER]understand, even for me. But I am sure that the[ENTER]agenda of these people is more than dubious. I[ENTER]have to find out more about them!
9714	Then I have to ask a stronger hero. Farewell.
9715	Thank you.[ENTER]I hope you are more successful this time!
9716	The Temple of Darkness
9717	The Temple of Darkness
9718	Soon is obsessed with unravelling the secrets of[ENTER]the Temple of Darkness.
9719	But he could certainly use your help in this! Go[ENTER]to him and find out more.
9720	I need more facts for my studies. I think the[ENTER]Temple Doctrine, the Temple Scarf and the[ENTER]Translation of the Cursebook might come in quite[ENTER]useful. Can you bring me these things. I would be[ENTER]very grateful![ENTER]And don't hang about too long, I need them soon!
9721	I'll go straight away.
9722	Do you want to accept the mission?
9723	I'm asking for your help! If you are too busy[ENTER]now, come back later. Perhaps you'll have more[ENTER]time then. I'll be waiting for you.
9724	I asked for your help and you just turn your back[ENTER]on me?[ENTER]Oh, well, we don't need you anyway... now push[ENTER]off!
9725	Thanks!
9726	Temple of Darkness
9728	Good luck on your search! I can only manufacture[ENTER]the right porcelain if I have the right[ENTER]materials. My customers are waiting really[ENTER]impatiently!
9727	The secret of the pale green porcelain
9729	Pale green porcelain
9730	Celadon Porcelain
9731	You have all the material that Yonah needs to[ENTER]make the Celadon Porcelain. Take it to Yonah!
9732	So that Yonah can manufacture Celadon Porcelain,[ENTER]he needs the following materials:[ENTER]Desert Sand from the Desert Outlaws in the Yongbi[ENTER]desert, Crystal Ore from the crystal mine and[ENTER]Monkey Blood from the Strong Stone Apes or the[ENTER]Strong Gold Apes at the Sangsun Dong. Find all[ENTER]three materials and take them to Yonah!
9733	The secret of the pale green porcelain
9734	I've obtained all materials.
9735	You've done it! Thank you! With the right[ENTER]technique and the right materials I can produce[ENTER]wonderful pale green porcelain. The income that I[ENTER]get from it will be a blessing for my purse.[ENTER]Here, take this reward. You have earned it. I'm[ENTER]going to start producing porcelain immediately!
9736	You have received 3,000,000 experience points.
9737	You have received 30,000 Yang.
9739	The Secret of the Pale Green Porcelain
9738	Hello adventurer! Didn't you bring me Soon's[ENTER]notes how to make Celadon Porcelain recently? I[ENTER]have a problem... Although I know the technique I[ENTER]don't seem to manage to manufacture genuine[ENTER]Celadon Porcelain.[ENTER]It's probably because I used my regular[ENTER]ingredients instead of the material written down[ENTER]in the notes which is difficult to get.
9740	The Secret of the Pale Green Porcelain
9741	Yonah just can't seem to produce any Celadon[ENTER]Porcelain.
9742	Go to him. He could probably use a hand.
9743	I need finely ground Desert Sand, Crystal Ore and[ENTER]Monkey Blood. If you mix these and add them to[ENTER]the Clay it gets really hard when fired. Also the[ENTER]glaze gets its typically pale green colour which[ENTER]looks like jade. This colour is very popular with[ENTER]customers and I really need to sell more!
9744	You get the Desert Sand from the Desert Outlaws,[ENTER]you can get the Crystal Ore from crystal mines[ENTER]and to get the Monkey Blood, you will have to[ENTER]kill monkeys in the Sangsun Dong. Can you get[ENTER]these materials for me? I know, it won't be easy[ENTER]but I will reward you generously.
9745	Accept
9746	Refuse
9747	Do you want to quit the quest?
9748	If you are too busy now, come back later.
9749	You're giving up? Really? Then I guess I'll have[ENTER]to look for everything myself. I really need this[ENTER]porcelain. Good bye and good luck.
9752	Ah! That's it.
9750	Enemies sighted on horizon
9751	Captain
9753	I don't know.
9754	Show me again.
9755	Do you want to quit the quest?
9756	Think about it again, and come back later. But[ENTER]don't tell anybody about it!
9757	Oh dear! Is it that difficult? You were my last[ENTER]hope... Who will be able to decipher it now?
9758	Okay, but be quick. Otherwise somebody is going[ENTER]to get suspicious...[ENTER][ENTER]SEE MINE[ENTER]THE DIGS[ENTER]NO[ENTER]HR IN ZOO
9759	And? What does this code mean?
9760	Yes, you are right! Now I also understand. I'm[ENTER]proud of you. You are one of our best soldiers![ENTER]This sentence is an agreed password. It means[ENTER]that Yu-Hwan has exposed the enemy spies and we[ENTER]have take action against them. I will give out[ENTER]the necessary orders immediately.
9761	You receive 1,300,000 experience points.
9762	Why are you so quiet? Don't you know?
9765	I have to think about it again.
9763	Enemies sighted on horizon.
9764	About the secret code...
9766	I give up.
9767	Oh dear! Is it that hard? You were my last[ENTER]hope... Who is going to decipher it now?
9768	So, what does it mean?
9769	Yes, you are right! Now I understand. I'm proud[ENTER]of you. You are one of our best soldiers! This[ENTER]sentence is an agreed password. It means that[ENTER]Yu-Hwan has exposed the enemy spies and we have[ENTER]take action against them. I will give out the[ENTER]necessary orders immediately.
9770	You have received 2,300,000 experience points.
9771	You'll find out. Come back when you are ready!
9772	Hmm, that doesn't mean anything to me. What did[ENTER]he mean by that. I don't think that is right.[ENTER]Think again.
9773	I'll try it again.
9774	I give up.
9776	So? What does the message mean?

It[ENTER]takes me ages to decipher it. And it has to be[ENTER]dealt with quickly. Last time you managed to do[ENTER]it quite easily. Please, would you help me again?
9782	Yes, you are right! Now I also understand. I'm[ENTER]proud of you. You are one of our best soldiers![ENTER]This sentence is an agreed password. It means[ENTER]that Yu-Hwan has exposed the enemy spies and we[ENTER]have take action against them. I will give out[ENTER]the necessary orders immediately.

9787	The Captain is looking for you! He's received[ENTER]some secret information and needs your help.
9788	Go to him to learn more.
9789	Do you want to give up the quest?
9790	But you managed to do it last time. Why are you[ENTER]hesitating now? Think about it again.
9791	I know what you mean.[ENTER]You don't want to work with us any more, right?[ENTER]That's a pity. There aren't many brave warriors.
9792	Oh! You're my saviour! Look, this is the code.[ENTER]Have a close look!
9793	SEE MINE[ENTER]THE DIGS[ENTER]NO[ENTER]HR IN ZOO[ENTER][ENTER]Can you decipher that?

9795	Find the spy
9797	One of the spies lives as a fisherman in the[ENTER]village Pyungmo in the Jinno kingdom. Try getting[ENTER]in contact with him discreetly and take his[ENTER]report to the Captain.
9798	One of the spies lives as a fisherman in the[ENTER]village Yongan in the Shinsoo kingdom. Try[ENTER]getting in contact with him discreetly and take[ENTER]his report to the Captain.
9799	One of the spies lives as a fisherman in the[ENTER]village Joan in the Chunjo kingdom. Try getting[ENTER]in contact with him discreetly and take his[ENTER]report to the Captain.
9800	What are you doing?
9801	Pssh, be quiet! You're scaring away all the fish.[ENTER]Why are you here anyway? You're so loud and[ENTER]clumsy; you can't be here for fishing.
9802	Ah, I understand. I have been expecting you for a[ENTER]while; you are late. It wasn't easy to get this[ENTER]information without being caught. You have to[ENTER]understand that the enemy is everywhere, and all[ENTER]he is doing is waiting for you to accidentally[ENTER]blow your cover.
9803	Now we shouldn't hang around here too long![ENTER]After all, we don't want someone to discover us.[ENTER]Here are the documents. Now set off immediately[ENTER]and take them directly to the Captain.
9804	One moment, please! I have something for you.[ENTER]A little present. Now be on your way.
9805	You are curious and open the package to see what[ENTER]the spy has given you.
9807	Great! Grilled Rudd! The spy obviously really[ENTER]does know something about fishing.
9806	Relax, soldier![ENTER]Since all our neighbouring countries are enemies,[ENTER]it is important to have friends there who go[ENTER]undercover and help us gather information, so[ENTER]that we can prepare for any potential attacks. It[ENTER]is extremely important that the cover of these[ENTER]spies is never blown.
9808	You have received 3 Grilled Rudds.
9809	Return to the Captain
9810	The Captain
9811	The dangerous journey to Pyungmoo in the Jinno[ENTER]kingdom was successful: You have received the[ENTER]report from the spy who is disguised as a[ENTER]fisherman.[ENTER]Now go back to your kingdom and quickly take that[ENTER]information to the Captain.
9812	The dangerous journey to Yongan in the Shinsoo[ENTER]kingdom was successful: You have received the[ENTER]report from the spy who is disguised as a[ENTER]fisherman.[ENTER]Now go back to your kingdom and quickly take that[ENTER]information to the Captain.
9813	The dangerous journey to Joan in the Chunjo[ENTER]kingdom was successful: You have received the[ENTER]report from the spy who is disguised as a[ENTER]fisherman.[ENTER]Now go back to your kingdom and quickly take that[ENTER]information to the Captain.
9814	The mission was successful!
9815	Are these the documents? Great! Thanks. Now that[ENTER]we know about the plans of our enemies we can[ENTER]prepare accordingly to protect ourselves. You[ENTER]have done the kingdom a great service!
9816	You have received 5,500,000 experience points.
9818	You have received 50,000 Yang.
9817	Surely, you know Yu-Hwan the musician, don't you?[ENTER]He's also a spy and works for us. One spy alone[ENTER]doesn't help though, so we have several all over[ENTER]the world. One of them is in the first village[ENTER]pretending to be a fisherman.

Yes, I mean you![ENTER]Would you please go to this Fisherman and get me[ENTER]his latest report.[ENTER]It is vitally important for the safety of our[ENTER]kingdom!
9824	Do you want to quit this quest?
9825	You want to prepare yourself first? Okay, then[ENTER]come back later. I'll be waiting for you. But[ENTER]please hurry up; I need this report!
9826	What's wrong with you? Last time, you did[ENTER]fantastic work for us! And now you just want to[ENTER]abandon your country? But there's nothing I can[ENTER]do about it. Farewell.
9827	I knew I could rely on you. Good luck and be[ENTER]careful!
9828	Meet the spy
9830	What is Bingsu
9829	Bingsu?
9831	Taurean has had a row with Harang because he[ENTER]doesn't believe her that you can make ice cream[ENTER]in the summer. Go to Harang and ask her what she[ENTER]knows about Bingsu.
9832	Ask Harang
9833	Ask Harang
9834	What is Bingsu?
9835	That Taurean also pretends he knows everything.[ENTER]He doesn't even know Bingsu! How can you not know[ENTER]about something so delicious?[ENTER]You don't know what Bingsu is either?? Well you'd[ENTER]best go to Octavio in the neighbouring village.[ENTER]He's a famous chef and knows lots of good[ENTER]recipes. He made me Bingsu once... mmmmh.[ENTER]He will prove to you that I'm right!
9836	Let's go see Octavio
9837	Taurean absolutely wants to know what Bingsu is.[ENTER]Go to the restaurant owner Octavio. I'm sure he[ENTER]can help you.
9838	Do you know what Bingsu is?
9839	Bingsu? Of course, I know that. Every good cook[ENTER]knows how to make Bingsu! First of all you need[ENTER]finely crushed ice. Then you put sugar, thinly[ENTER]sliced rice cakes and finally fresh fruit for[ENTER]decoration.
9841	Why do you ask? Because Taurean and Harang are[ENTER]arguing? That's nothing new. But Harang is right.[ENTER]Bingsu is an especially popular food in hot[ENTER]summers. Taurean is a good boy actually, evn if[ENTER]he is sometimes a little petty. If you get the[ENTER]ingredients I could make Bingsu for him.
9840	Bingsu?
9842	I would like to give Taurean a treat and give him[ENTER]Bingsu. What do you think? Can you go get Ice[ENTER]from Mount Sohan?
9843	Do you want to quit this quest?
9844	Don't you like ice cream? Or have you eaten too[ENTER]much already? It's for Taurean so please think[ENTER]about it again.
9845	Pity. Taurean is going to be very disappointed.[ENTER]See you.
9846	Very good. I need Chunks of Ice from the[ENTER]Enchanted Ice on Mount Sohan. Bring me 50 Chunks[ENTER]of Ice. Then I can make some yummy Bingsu.
9847	Go to Octavio
9848	%s[ENTER]You have got the Chunks of Ice for Taurean's[ENTER]Bingsu.[ENTER]Take them to Octavio.
9849	Got the Chunks of Ice
9850	Octavio has agreed to make Bingsu for Taurean but[ENTER]needs ice to do that. Kill Enchanted Ice on Mount[ENTER]Sohan and collect 50 Chunks of Ice. Take them to[ENTER]Octavio afterwards.
9851	Looking for ice
9852	Here, I have brought Chunks of Ice.
9854	Ah, very good! The most difficult part of making[ENTER]Bingsu is done. Now I just have to put a little[ENTER]sugar... and some fruit... Here you are! An ice[ENTER]cream for Taurean. Take it now, then he will soon[ENTER]forget his anger.
9853	Taurean:
9855	Sorry, but that's not enough. You have to get[ENTER]more otherwise it will be just a tiny portion!
9856	Try again
9857	I know it's a long way and the monsters are[ENTER]strong. If it is too difficult for you then there[ENTER]is nothing we can do about it. See you.
9858	Try again. With your courage and stamina you can[ENTER]make it!
9859	Bingsu!
9860	It is done: Octavio has made Bingsu out of the[ENTER]ice from Mount Sohan. Quickly go back to Taurean[ENTER]before it melts.
9861	Here's the Bingsu!
9862	That's Bingsu? That tastes really good. Nice and[ENTER]cool. I've never tasted anything like it before,[ENTER]thanks! So Harang is right. I know have to[ENTER]apologize to her...
9863	You receive 6,000,000 experience points.
9865	You have received 70,000 Yang.
9864	Today, I had an argument with Harang. I could...[ENTER]She claims that there is something very tasty[ENTER]made of crushed ice. It's called Bingsu.
9866	You have received a Scroll of War.
9867	Did you remember to bring me some Bingsu?
9868	Oh dear, I completely forgot about that! Hmm,[ENTER]shall I keep trying? Or should I rather leave it?
9869	Yes, I will continue.
9870	I give up.
9871	I can't do it, I'm sorry.
9872	Bingsu?
9873	Bingsu?
9874	Taurean looks like he could use your help.
9876	Why don't you go see him?
9875	Something like that is only possible in the[ENTER]winter when it's really cold. But she keeps[ENTER]claiming that it'll work. Can you find out[ENTER]whether you can also make this Bingsu in the[ENTER]summer? If such a thing even exists...
9877	I'm sure this Bingsu is delicious! Are you sure[ENTER]that you will never help me to make it?
9878	If you want to do it later, please let me know.
9879	I'd really love to try Bingsu...[ENTER]But you are right. Harang probably only wants to[ENTER]show off and Bingsu doesn't exist! Goodbye.
9880	Thanks for your help. Let me know whether you'll[ENTER]find something out. Then I can give this Harang a[ENTER]piece of my mind!
12788	Prove Your Skills
12789	Go to one of the marked locations in the Seo[ENTER]Gwang Wastelands and kill 5 Quag Primuses.
12790	Could you help me? I have something here that[ENTER]needs to be taken to Sung Mahi Tower. Could you[ENTER]take it there for me?
12791	Of course!
12792	No.
12793	You want me to believe that you're so busy that[ENTER]you can't do this small favour for me? Well, then[ENTER]I guess I'll have to ask someone else.
12794	Ah, fantastic. This delivery is really important,[ENTER]so you should clear the route to Sung Mahi Tower[ENTER]first by hunting Quag Primuses. They're the[ENTER]leaders of Sung Mahi's troops and have positioned[ENTER]themselves around the streets. Then come back to[ENTER]me and I'll give you the delivery.
12795	Understood. I'll come back after I've defeated a[ENTER]few Quag Primuses.
12796	Take good care of yourself! Kill 5 Quag Primuses[ENTER]in the Seo Gwang Wastelands and then come back.
12797	You killed the Quag Primuses. Go back to the[ENTER]General Store Saleswoman.
12798	So you still haven't killed the Quag Primuses?[ENTER]Maybe I should ask someone else. Every delay[ENTER]causes big problems, so please take care of this[ENTER]fast.
12799	Finally, you're here! Once you've proven your[ENTER]skills, I'll give you the delivery for the[ENTER]saleswoman in Sung Mahi Tower.[ENTER]Come back again later and the goods should be[ENTER]ready.
12800	Killed: %d. Remaining: %d
12889	Go to the General Store Saleswoman in the Dong[ENTER]Gwang Plain.
12968	You killed all of the Quag Primuses! Go back to[ENTER]the General Store Saleswoman.
12801	Bring the Delivery to the Destination Safely
12802	Here are the goods to be delivered. Can you[ENTER]safely deliver them to the Sung Mahi Tower[ENTER]undamaged?
12803	You have to hand it over to the saleswoman in the[ENTER]tower. It's an item that's very important for[ENTER]weakening Sung Mahi's Presence. So I hope you'll[ENTER]get it there without any problems. Would you do[ENTER]that for me?
12804	Yes.
12805	No.
12806	Then I'll have to look for someone else to help[ENTER]me.
12807	I don't think there's anyone else who could take[ENTER]on this task. I'm certain I can do it.
12808	Thank you very much. Deliver it to the saleswoman[ENTER]in Sung Mahi Tower.
12809	Deliver the goods to the saleswoman in Sung Mahi[ENTER]Tower. You can find her in Sung Mahi Tower at the[ENTER]end of the Seo Gwang Wastelands.
12810	What are you doing still standing around here?[ENTER]Hurry up and get to Sung Mahi Tower in the Seo[ENTER]Gwang Wastelands.
12811	What are you doing here then? Oh! The delivery[ENTER]finally arrived. The fact that you made it here[ENTER]proves how strong you are. The General Store[ENTER]Saleswoman sent you to weaken Sung Mahi's[ENTER]Presence, so please face the challenges of the[ENTER]tower.
12812	This tower was built by Sung Mahi's followers,[ENTER]and the follower's inside will give you various[ENTER]missions and try to stop you from reaching the[ENTER]next level. Take the challenge and reach the 50th[ENTER]level of Sung Mahi Tower. I'll now give you a[ENTER]ticket to enter the tower. Enter through the[ENTER]portal and climb the tower as fast as you can.[ENTER]The faster you are, the better loot you'll find,[ENTER]and you'll also receive rewards for the first[ENTER]time you complete a level. You can receive[ENTER]different missions every time you enter, so[ENTER]always be on your guard!
12813	The General Store Saleswoman is waiting for you[ENTER]with the delivery.
12814	Report On the Conditions in Sung Mahi Tower
12815	The saleswoman in the tower is looking for you.
12816	Finally, you're here! How was the challenge in[ENTER]Sung Mahi Tower? It looks like there are many[ENTER]strong monsters there, but was it worth it?
12817	I hope that you'll face Sung Mahi Tower again so[ENTER]you can keep an eye on this place. I deal a lot[ENTER]with the adventurers who tackle the tower. That's[ENTER]why I want you to go to the 5th floor of the[ENTER]tower and take a little look around while you're[ENTER]there. Would that be possible?
12818	Yes.
12819	No.
12820	Sung Mahi Tower needs someone like you. I really[ENTER]hope you'll take on the challenge again.
12821	Yes, I'll battle through to the 5th floor and[ENTER]then report back.
12822	You still haven't faced the challenge? I'll give[ENTER]you a hint: you can complete the mission by[ENTER]defeating 2 monsters of different colours. You[ENTER]don't have to do anything else. Try it!
12823	Complete the 5th level of Sung Mahi Tower.
12824	Go to the saleswoman in the tower.
12825	Ah there you are! Did you take a look at the 5th[ENTER]floor? Please go to Confucius and report to him[ENTER]what you saw there. You can find him on the Dong[ENTER]Gwang Plain.
12826	Yes, I'll go to Confucius and report to him.
12827	Let Confucius on the Dong Gwang Plain know about[ENTER]the current situation.
12828	Did you scout out the situation in Sung Mahi[ENTER]Tower? So, their power is growing. If they keep[ENTER]going like this, they could present a threat to[ENTER]the old world, too.
12829	Weaken the Presence 1
12830	Confucius is looking for the right person to[ENTER]weaken Sung Mahi's Presence.
12831	You're the one who reported to me about the[ENTER]situation in Sung Mahi's Tower last time. I have[ENTER]a request for you. Will you join us and help me[ENTER]to weaken Sung Mahi's Presence?
12832	Yes.
12833	No.
12834	Don't you care about the safety of the old[ENTER]continent? Think it over again.
12835	Oh wait, I was impatient. Metin stones are[ENTER]appearing in the Nam Gwang Chasm right now. If we[ENTER]get rid of them, the presence will dwindle. Would[ENTER]you take care of this and destroy them? We have[ENTER]to hurry. Will you do this?
12836	Yes, I will weaken Sung Mahi's Presence.
12867	Destroy %d Metins of Mindfulness in the Nam Gwang[ENTER]Chasm. Remaining: %d
12868	You can reach the Nam Gwang Chasm from the Seo[ENTER]Gwang Wastelands in the south. Destroy Metins of[ENTER]Mindfulness and then come back.
12869	Destroyed: %d Remaining: %d
12870	You've destroyed all the Metins of Mindfulness.[ENTER]Report to Confucius on the Dong Gwang Plain about[ENTER]it.
12871	Return to Confucius and report to him on what's[ENTER]happening.
12872	Even if we defeat its presence, it won't be[ENTER]enough. But every little bit counts. I have a[ENTER]small present for you to say thank you. I'll come[ENTER]to you again next time.
12873	Weaken the Presence 2
12874	Confucius is once again looking for the right[ENTER]person to weaken Sung Mahi's Presence.
12875	I have a request for you. Will you join us and[ENTER]help me again to weaken Sung Mahi's Presence?
12876	Yes.
12877	No.
12878	Yes, I'll do it.
12879	Don't you care about the safety of the old[ENTER]continent? Think it over again.
12880	Thanks to your help, this time I was able to[ENTER]develop a special technique that should hopefully[ENTER]be useful to you. I hope you come back[ENTER]victorious. Oh wait, I was being impatient again.[ENTER]More Metin stones have appeared in the Nam Gwang[ENTER]Chasm. If we get rid of them, the presence will[ENTER]dwindle. Would you take care of this and destroy[ENTER]them? We don't have much time! Don't forget that[ENTER]the buff I gave you only lasts for 10 minutes!
12881	Destroy %d Metins of the Jin in the Nam Gwang[ENTER]Chasm. Remaining: %d
12882	Go south to the Nam Gwang Chasm. Destroy Metins[ENTER]of the Jin and then come back.
12883	Destroyed: %d Remaining: %d
12884	You destroyed all of the Metins of the Jin.[ENTER]Report to Confucius on the Dong Gwang Plain about[ENTER]it.
12885	Return to Confucius and report to him on what's[ENTER]happening.
12886	Its influence has been weakened, but it still[ENTER]won't be enough. But every little bit counts. I[ENTER]have a small present for you to say thank you.
12914	An Unknown Land
12915	As I was wandering around, trying to find out[ENTER]more about this strange rumour, I finally arrived[ENTER]in an unknown land. We should take a closer look[ENTER]at this place in order to find out whether it is[ENTER]the source of the rumour.
12916	I can see someone there in the distance. We[ENTER]should approach them cautiously.
12917	There's a nervous person sitting in the corner.[ENTER]We should talk to him.
13541	A new quest has been added.
12918	A Curious Person
12919	Go to the curious person and speak to them.
12920	My goodness!
12921	Who are you?! How did you manage to find your way[ENTER]here?
12922	Hey! Who are you? I'm a Bounty Hunter and came[ENTER]all this way to track the rumour to this village.[ENTER]You as well? Well, I have to investigate[ENTER]something here. If you help me, I'll gladly tell[ENTER]you what I've found out so far.
12923	Decline
12924	I'll help you.
12925	What a coward...
12926	I think there's something big going on here.[ENTER]First, we should take a look around and kill some[ENTER]Tainted Soldiers. It's too dangerous there, so[ENTER]let's meet up here again later.
12927	Kill Tainted Soldiers.[ENTER]Remaining opponents: %d
12928	Don't waste any time! I won't tell you anything[ENTER]if you just stand around here.
12929	I've killed all the Tainted Soldiers and should[ENTER]return to the Bounty Hunter.
12930	Well done. Here is your reward. I will tell you[ENTER]how we are going to proceed. So come back again[ENTER]later.
12931	A Strange Rumour
12932	I should ask the Bounty Hunter about the rumour[ENTER]about Yilad Pass.
12933	Things are looking a bit clearer now. The[ENTER]rumour?! How do you know about that? There's a[ENTER]hidden altar near here and a very powerful[ENTER]monster is causing havoc there. It seems you[ENTER]already know about this rumour. Very well then,[ENTER]let me tell you something else then.
12935	Are they all gone?
12936	Not quite. They have built the Serpent Temple[ENTER]where they are getting stronger. My goal is to[ENTER]kill their leader and collect the bounty. But it[ENTER]is so difficult to get to her as at there is a[ENTER]guardian near the altar. You could help me hunt[ENTER]down those monsters, if you like? It's really[ENTER]difficult to break through their ranks alone.
12937	Not right now.
12938	I knew you wouldn't let me down. A helping hand[ENTER]is always good. Then let's make our way to the[ENTER]altar.
12939	I should kill Tainted Warriors to clear the way.[ENTER]Monsters remaining: %d
12940	So, how's it going? Made any progress yet?[ENTER]Doesn't seem like it... Please hurry, we don't[ENTER]have much time.
12941	I've hunted down all the Tainted Warriors and[ENTER]cleared a path. I should return to the Bounty[ENTER]Hunter.
12942	All the Tainted Warriors have been killed. Return[ENTER]to the Bounty Hunter.
12943	Well done. Now I can see our path. Let's move on[ENTER]to the next area quickly. It seems we're[ENTER]approaching their refuge.
12966	May I?
12967	All right, I'll go back then. If you change your[ENTER]mind, you can come back whenever you like.
12944	A Hidden Altar
12945	I think I can already make out some of the hidden[ENTER]altar. Head back to the Bounty Hunter quickly.
12946	Yes, that's right! After fighting my way through[ENTER]all the monsters, I reached the altar. But the[ENTER]guardian wouldn't let me in. I pleaded with him[ENTER]several times, but it didn't work and I had no[ENTER]choice but to turn back. But now, thanks to you,[ENTER]I have another chance! Let's push on together.
12947	I can't keep going.
12948	All right.
12949	What, you're giving up so soon? You are much[ENTER]weaker than I thought.
12950	If we buckle down, we can do it. Let's clear some[ENTER]monsters out of the way around here.
12951	Kill Tainted Monks to clear the rest of the way.[ENTER]Remaining opponents: %d
12952	You're giving up so close to our target? I can[ENTER]give you a share of my bounty. Come on.
12953	All the Tainted Monks have been killed. Return to[ENTER]the Bounty Hunter.
12954	I can already make out the guardian in the[ENTER]distance, watching over the Serpent Temple. I[ENTER]think we will make it to the entrance to the[ENTER]altar, thanks to you.
12955	Infiltration
12956	I've found the Altar. I should check it out and[ENTER]find out where the guardian is.
12957	You have finally found the Altar. Thanks for[ENTER]sticking with me this far. Now we can sneak past[ENTER]the guardian to where the leader is hiding, and[ENTER]find out what's going on there. However, I fear[ENTER]they might spot us if we stick together. So, my[ENTER]suggestion is that we split up and try to gather[ENTER]more useful information as we go.
12958	I've had enough.
12959	Let's go!
12960	We've almost made it. Please reconsider.
12961	I hope we're both still in one piece the next[ENTER]time we see each other.
12962	Sneak past the altar guardian, into the temple[ENTER]and find out what's going on inside. Hunt 30[ENTER]Kappa Soldiers[ENTER]Monsters remaining: %d
12963	You still haven't left? I'll go on ahead then, I[ENTER]suppose.
12964	The Serpent Temple has been scouted and 30 Kappa[ENTER]Soldiers have been hunted. Return to the Bounty[ENTER]Hunter.
12965	I knew you'd do it! I've also had a quick look[ENTER]inside, but I'm afraid I couldn't find the[ENTER]leader. Ah well, it is what it is. Perhaps next[ENTER]time. Anyway, I only made it here thanks to you[ENTER]and I want to reward you for your help. Here,[ENTER]please take this..
13054	Follow the flashing dot on your minimap.
13597	You haven't found the Serpent Temple yet?[ENTER]That place won't be easy to reach. So make sure[ENTER]you're skilled enough to face the Serpent Temple.
12679	Sung Mahi Tower Entrance Hall
12680	Do you want to enter Sung Mahi Tower?
12681	Yes
12682	No
12683	Sung Mahi Tower
12715	What's on offer?
12716	To the Shop
12717	Sung Mahi's power is so strong here that normal[ENTER]items have no effect.[ENTER]In the tower you'll only be able to use the items[ENTER]I'm selling here.
12777	You cannot enter while you are riding.
12778	You cannot enter while you are transformed.
11078	Sushi Event
11079	Konnichiwa!
11080	Do you like sushi?
11081	You know, that delicacy from Japan!
11082	Hmm... I'm not sure.
11083	Maybe?
11084	Those are tasty little morsels made of cold rice[ENTER]and raw fish.
11085	
11086	Good sushi is a real delicacy! Mmm...
11087	These days it isn't easy to get fresh fish good[ENTER]enough for sushi.
11088	Could you help me? I'll give you some in return.
11089	Accept
11090	Decline
11091	Hmm, okay. You're clearly not a sushi fan.
11092	Come back if you change your mind.
11093	Oh yes! I knew you were a connoisseur!
11094	Thank you so much!
11095	Sushi Cravings
11096	Octavio wants to make some sushi.
11097	But it's difficult to get hold of fresh fish good[ENTER]enough for sushi.
11098	That's why he needs your help.
11099	Get out there and fetch Octavio some fresh fish.
11100	You'll of course get your share of his famous[ENTER]sushi!
11101	
11102	
11103	
11104	Fish for Sushi
11105	Hmm...
11106	Unfortunately this fish isn't good enough.
11107	This is good enough for fish soup at best.
11108	I can't make use of it, so keep it yourself.
11109	
11110	Oi!
11111	Are you this good at everything you do?
11112	I've never seen such a fantastic fresh fish.
11113	Just look at it!
11114	Which fish should I make sushi out of?
11115	Zander
11116	Salmon
11117	Catfish
11118	Carp
11119	I can't make sushi from this fish.
11120	I need a Zander for making Zander Sushi.
11121	
11122	Wait a second...
11123	Finished! Here you go.
11124	Here's your Zander Sushi.
11125	You absolutely have to try this.
11126	Oh, I'm very sorry.
11127	It seems the fish wasn't that fresh after all.
11128	The sushi is inedible.
11129	It'll work better next time!
11130	I need a Salmon for making Salmon Sushi.
11131	Here's your Salmon Sushi.
11132	I need a Catfish for making Catfish Sushi.
11133	Here's your Catfish Sushi.
11134	I need a Carp for making Carp Sushi.
11135	Here's your Carp Sushi.
11136	Restart the Sushi Event?

9905	You have defeated 5 Ice Golems.[ENTER]Return to the Storekeeper.
9906	What's wrong?
9907	People are always coming here, absorbed in their[ENTER]own affairs, but no one cares about me.[ENTER][ENTER]I've got so much to do![ENTER]I can't be everywhere at once![ENTER][ENTER]While I was in the storeroom, I was attacked by[ENTER]monsters.
9908	What monsters? I'll bash their skulls in!

9943	I'm sorry, but you do not have the necessary[ENTER]riding experience to improve your mount. You at[ENTER]least need to have the Battle Horse License.
9944	Sorry, but without the correct documents there[ENTER]isn't anything I can do for you. Don't try to[ENTER]pull one on me again, or I'll make you pay for[ENTER]it.
9945	Where is your Mount Seal? I can't improve any[ENTER]mounts without this seal. Check behind the[ENTER]spinning coin.[ENTER]You can find a certificate there that you can[ENTER]swap for a Mount Seal.
9946	I want to ride a new mount!
9947	Hey! You're still riding a horse?! Really? You[ENTER]know we can tame wild animals these days right?
9948	To train tamed wild animals for battle, you[ENTER]should definitely have a good riding proficiency.[ENTER]On top of that, you will also need the following[ENTER]items: the Scroll of Evolution, to improve your[ENTER]mount to a wild mount and the Scroll of Mutation,[ENTER]to make it into a valiant mount.
9949	If you have any questions, you can always visit[ENTER]me again. I'll help you as much as I can.
9950	I want to improve my mount!
9951	So you want to improve your mount? Do you know[ENTER]how it works? OK, I'll explain it to you.
9952	To improve your mount to a wild mount you need to[ENTER]go on the hunt for the Scroll of Evolution. Find[ENTER]the Scroll of Mutation so that you can train the[ENTER]wild creature to become a valiant mount. They say[ENTER]that they are hidden in a faraway land populated[ENTER]with dangerous giants!
9953	Bring me these scrolls and I will improve your[ENTER]mount. You don't happen to have them on you[ENTER]already?
9954	Yes, I want to improve my mount!
9955	No, not right now.
9956	Ah, you have on of the scrolls with you. Which[ENTER]one is it then? The Scroll of Evolution will let[ENTER]you train an inexperienced young animal for[ENTER]battle. The Scroll of Mutation you can improve it[ENTER]to become a valiant mount.
9957	I've got the Scroll of Mutation.
9958	I've got the Scroll of Evolution.
9959	I don't have any scrolls on me.
9960	Ah, look - the Scroll of Evolution! OK, let me[ENTER]take a look at your Mount Seal. Some people have[ENTER]been trying to get me to accept fakes! I'll check[ENTER]its authenticity first. Pass it here. (Drag the[ENTER]seal onto the Stable Boy.)
9961	The Scroll of Mutation! Up till now I'd only[ENTER]heard stories. I've never actually held one in my[ENTER]hands. Show me your Mount Seal then. I will[ENTER]exchange it for a more powerful one, once I've[ENTER]checked its authenticity. (Drag the seal onto the[ENTER]Stable Boy.)
9962	As soon as you have found one of the scrolls,[ENTER]return to me. I'll then be able to exchange your[ENTER]old Mount Seal for a more powerful one.
9963	Your Mount Seal has definitely seen better days.[ENTER]Hang on, I'll exchange it for a new one. Please,[ENTER]take it. Now you can summon your wild mount.[ENTER]Return to me if you happen to discover the Scroll[ENTER]of Mutation. I'll use it to make you an even[ENTER]stronger Mount Seal.
9964	That is the Mount Seal that you got from me a[ENTER]while back. It's already pretty worn. Give it[ENTER]back to me and I'll create you a Mount Seal that[ENTER]is even more powerful!
9965	This seal allows you to summon your transformed[ENTER]mount. Its value is priceless so take good care[ENTER]of it!
9966	Can I use horse skills?
9967	You want to use some horse skills? You're pretty[ENTER]demanding! Although I too dream of them... Very[ENTER]well. To learn them you need to follow a few[ENTER]rules.
9968	First things first, you need to master riding,[ENTER]otherwise you'll be putting yourself in serious[ENTER]danger. On top of that, your mount needs to be[ENTER]battle-ready, as it is only then ready to make[ENTER]use of horse skills.
9969	Is your mount ready to learn horse skills? I[ENTER]won't be able to allow the training to proceed if[ENTER]it isn't. What do you want to do?
9970	I understand. I will now assess your strength and[ENTER]riding proficiency. Please wait a moment.
9971	Hmm... strong backbone, sound riding proficiency[ENTER]and your mount is extremely keen on battle. You[ENTER]can use horse skills.
9972	Now your mount can use horse skills. However, if[ENTER]you get a new mount, it will also have to learn[ENTER]the skills. In that instance, just come back to[ENTER]me.
9973	Come on, I already told you that it is dangerous[ENTER]if you are unable to ride. Return to me when you[ENTER]know how.
9974	I'm afraid your mount is not quite ready yet.[ENTER]Return to me when it shows more desire for battle.
9975	Could you perhaps climb down from your mount[ENTER]while we are talking? I have a stiff neck and it[ENTER]is pretty tiring, having to keep looking up at[ENTER]you the entire time.
9976	You do not have the appropriate riding licence to[ENTER]improve your mount. You need to at least have the[ENTER]Battle Horse Licence to train a wild mount. To[ENTER]tame a valiant mount, you need to have the[ENTER]Military Horse Licence.
9977	I see that you have a Power Snack. This valuable[ENTER]medicinal herb will provide your Power Mount with[ENTER]pure energy - it will extend its lifespan by a[ENTER]number of days. What should I do? Would you like[ENTER]me to extend the lifespan of your mount, or do[ENTER]you want to improve it?
9978	Extend
9979	Improve
9980	7 days
9981	15 days
9982	30 days
9983	Scroll of Mutation + 200k Yang
9984	Unfortunately you do not have the necessary Power[ENTER]Snack for the requested duration. But I'm sure[ENTER]you'll find it in the section behind the spinning[ENTER]coin!
9985	The Scroll of Mutation contains great power! It[ENTER]can extend the lifespan of your Valiant Mount by[ENTER]up to four days. An attempt will cost you 200,000[ENTER]Yang. Your mount will have to be exhausted and[ENTER]have less than a day's worth of lie remaining for[ENTER]the attempt though. Of course, a little luck also[ENTER]forms part of the process! Should the extension[ENTER]fail, I'd recommend feeding it a Power Snack.[ENTER]They can be found behind the spinning coin.
9986	Your Power Mount is still too strong. The Scroll[ENTER]of Mutation will have no effect here. Come back[ENTER]when it has less than a day left to live.
9987	Unfortunately I cannot help you. Either you are[ENTER]not carrying the Scroll of Mutation, or you[ENTER]possess less than 200,000 Yang.
9988	Riding time extended successfully.
9990	Your attempt at producing a scroll failed because[ENTER]you didn't have all the materials.
9989	Manufacture the Scroll of War
9991	Producing Dragon Scroll
9992	A Dragon Scroll increases your rate of success[ENTER]when improving an item. Even if it fails, the[ENTER]item's level will only be reduced by one. This is[ENTER]a mysterious item that can be seen as a type of[ENTER]upgraded Blessing Scroll.
9993	To make it, you need Magic Iron Ore.
9994	Magic Iron Ore
9995	To produce this, you need a Blessing Scroll.
9996	Do you have all the necessary items?[ENTER]Do you want to produce a Dragon Scroll? To[ENTER]produce a Dragon Scroll, you need a Blessing[ENTER]Scroll and Magic Iron Ore.
9997	You produced a Dragon Scroll! It really is a lot[ENTER]easier to produce a Dragon Scroll if you use[ENTER]Magic Iron Ore. I like that!
9998	Your attempt to produce the scroll failed because[ENTER]you didn't have all the materials.
9999	Produce a Blacksmith' Handbook
10001	Have you heard of the stone called Stone of the[ENTER]Blacksmith? Apparently it's a stone made from the[ENTER]blood and sweat of a blacksmith. If you bring me[ENTER]the Stone of the Blacksmith and a Blessing[ENTER]Scroll, I will make a handbook for you that has[ENTER]been passed on in my family for generations. It[ENTER]has the similar functions to the Dragon Scroll,[ENTER]but the rate of success is higher.
10000	These mysterious Scrolls of War improve +0 to +3[ENTER]items and have a 100% success rate. However, they[ENTER]don't work on items with +4 or above.
10002	To produce this, you need a Stone of the[ENTER]Blacksmith.
10003	Stone of the Blacksmith
10004	To produce it, you need a Blessing Scroll.
10005	Do you have all the necessary items? So, do you[ENTER]want me to make the handbook passed on by my[ENTER]family for generations?
10006	I have produced a Blacksmith's Handbook for you![ENTER]Now have the ancient knowledge of an entire[ENTER]blacksmith dynasty. Use it wisely! Ha, ha, ha!
10007	Blacksmith' Handbook
10008	I can't produce the Blacksmith' Handbook because[ENTER]you don't have the necessary materials.
10009	To produce this, you will need Magic Copper Ore.
10010	Magic Copper Ore
10011	You will additionally need a Blessing Scroll.
10012	Blessing Scroll
10013	Have you got all the necessary items? You still[ENTER]need another 200,000 Yang. If you have a Blessing[ENTER]Scroll, some Magic Copper Ore and 200,000 Yang[ENTER]you can produce a Scroll of War. Do you want to[ENTER]produce a scroll?
10014	You produced the scroll successfully! It really[ENTER]is a lot easier to produce a Scroll of War if you[ENTER]have Magic Copper Ore! I like that! Ha, ha, ha!
10015	Scroll of War
10017	Welcome! Do you know what Gold Bars are for? If[ENTER]you carry around Yang, it's like saying: Please[ENTER]kill me now![ENTER]That's why I swap people's Yang for Gold Bars and[ENTER]store these for them.
10016	I want to use the Storeroom.
10018	Ok, so I ask for a little more than the Gold Bar[ENTER]is worth. But such a service is still fair, isn't[ENTER]it? There's no reason to feel like you've been[ENTER]ripped off. As you know, it's very dangerous out[ENTER]there.
10019	Open Item Shop Storeroom
10020	The mines are all drained. It's hard to find gold[ENTER]or silver. As long as no new lode is found, there[ENTER]will be no more new gold or silver.
10021	Welcome! You want to see your item shop[ENTER]storeroom? Why have you come to see me then? Just[ENTER]look in your inventory, there's a direct entrance[ENTER]there.
10022	Enter the item shop storeroom any time you like[ENTER]by clicking on this symbol. Providing you haven't[ENTER]changed it, the password is 000000.
10023	The storeroom is now available.
10024	Storekeeper:
10025	Do you want to use the Storeroom?[ENTER]You will however, have to pay Yang to use the[ENTER]Storeroom. I'm in a good mood today so you can[ENTER]use it for just 500 Yang. So - come on, that's[ENTER]cheap, isn't it?
10026	What? Not enough Yang?[ENTER]Come back when you have enough.
10027	Your Storeroom is open now.[ENTER]If you want to use it, just talk to me.[ENTER]The password for your Storeroom is:
10028	000000
10029	You should change it for security reasons.[ENTER][ENTER]You might think that 45 boxes aren't enough. But[ENTER]who knows, maybe I'll give you more space if we[ENTER]get along well.
10030	Well, I'm not forcing anybody. If you don't feel[ENTER]like it come back later.
10031	Open Storeroom

10052	In football fever
10053	Hello! I'm an absolutely huge football fan. Some[ENTER]people think football is a matter of life and[ENTER]death. I assure you, it's much more serious than[ENTER]that.
10054	A wise man once said, "Football's all about the[ENTER]two M's - movement and positioning." How true,[ENTER]how very true...
10055	In life, as in football, you won't go far unless[ENTER]you know where the goalposts are. Sadly, I missed[ENTER]mine! I was kicking some balls around here[ENTER]earlier, but now I can't find any of them! Could[ENTER]you find them for me? I'll reward you with a[ENTER]golden football if you bring me %d footballs!
10056	A football!
10057	I can see the carrot at the end of the tunnel.
10058	When you are 4-0 up you should never lose 7-1.[ENTER]Come on, fetch me those footballs!
10059	Football is a simple game. Twenty-two men chase a[ENTER]ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans[ENTER]always win. But don't lose hope, keep looking.[ENTER]Bring me another %d and you'll get your reward.
10060	Ah, you're finished! Excellent. I'll swap %d[ENTER]footballs for your present. There you are, the[ENTER]golden football!
10061	I always used to put my right boot on first, and[ENTER]then obviously my right sock. But I only ever[ENTER]have one golden ball to swap each day. Come back[ENTER]tomorrow.
10062	More footballs!
10063	You're like one of those footballers whose brains[ENTER]are in their heads. I told you I only have one[ENTER]golden ball to swap each day. Come back tomorrow!
12673	Defeat the World Boss!
12674	Inflict the minimum amount of damage of %d to a[ENTER]world boss or more.
12675	Daily quest completed - you have inflicted the[ENTER]minimum amount of damage to a world boss.
12934	I came here to earn the bounty for this monster.[ENTER]Originally, this place was full of Serpent[ENTER]Monsters and was called Yilad Pass. But did you[ENTER]notice something strange? All those Serpent[ENTER]Monsters have disappeared.
